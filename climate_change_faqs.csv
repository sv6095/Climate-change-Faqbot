https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"The models used to calculate the IPCC’s temperature projections agree on the direction of future global change,
but the projected size of those changes cannot be precisely predicted. Future greenhouse gas (GHG) emission rates
could take any one of many possible trajectories, and some underlying physical processes are not yet completely
understood, making them difficult to model. Those uncertainties, combined with natural year-to-year climate
variability, produce an ‘uncertainty range’ in temperature projections.
The uncertainty range around projected GHG and aerosol precursor emissions (which depend on projections of
future social and economic conditions) cannot be materially reduced. Nevertheless, improved understanding and
climate models—along with observational constraints—may reduce the uncertainty range around some factors that
influence the climate’s response to those emission changes. The complexity of the climate system, however, makes
this a slow process.
Climate science has made many important advances since the last IPCC assessment report, thanks to improvements
in measurements and data analysis in the cryosphere, atmosphere, land, biosphere and ocean systems. Scientists
also have better understanding and tools to model the role of clouds, sea ice, aerosols, small-scale ocean mixing,
the carbon cycle and other processes. More observations mean that models can now be evaluated more thoroughly,
and projections can be better constrained. For example, as models and observational analysis have improved,
projections of sea level rise have become more accurate, balancing the current sea level rise budget.
Despite these advances, there is still a range in plausible projections for future global and regional climate—
what scientists call an ‘uncertainty range’. These uncertainty ranges are specific to the variable being considered
(precipitation vs. temperature, for instance) and the spatial and temporal extent (such as regional vs. global
averages). Uncertainties in climate projections arise from natural variability and uncertainty around the rate of
future emissions and the climate’s response to them. They can also occur because representations of some known
processes are as yet unrefined, and because some processes are not included in the models.
There are fundamental limits to just how precisely annual temperatures can be projected, because of the chaotic
nature of the climate system. Furthermore, decadal-scale projections are sensitive to prevailing conditions—such
as the temperature of the deep ocean—that are less well known. Some natural variability over decades arises from
interactions between the ocean, atmosphere, land, biosphere and cryosphere, and is also linked to phenomena such
as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (see Box 2.5 for details on patterns and
indices of climate variability).
Volcanic eruptions and variations in the sun’s output also contribute to natural variability, although they are
externally forced and explainable. This natural variability can be viewed as part of the ‘noise’ in the climate record,
which provides the backdrop against which the ‘signal’ of anthropogenic climate change is detected.
Natural variability has a greater influence on uncertainty at regional and local scales than it does over continental
or global scales. It is inherent in the Earth system, and more knowledge will not eliminate the uncertainties it brings.
However, some progress is possible—particularly for projections up to a few years ahead—which exploit advances
in knowledge of, for instance, the cryosphere or ocean state and processes. This is an area of active research. When
climate variables are averaged over decadal timescales or longer, the relative importance of internal variability
diminishes, making the long-term signals more evident (FAQ1.1, Figure 1). This long-term perspective is consistent
with a common definition of climate as an average over 30 years.
A second source of uncertainty stems from the many possible trajectories that future emission rates of GHGs
and aerosol precursors might take, and from future trends in land use. Nevertheless, climate projections rely on
input from these variables. So to obtain these estimates, scientists consider a number of alternative scenarios for
future human society, in terms of population, economic and technological change, and political choices. They then
estimate the likely emissions under each scenario. The IPCC informs policymaking, therefore climate projections
for different emissions scenarios can be useful as they show the possible climatic consequences of different policy
choices. These scenarios are intended to be compatible with the full range of emissions scenarios described in the
current scientific literature, with or without climate policy. As such, they are designed to sample uncertainty in
future scenarios. Projections for the next few years and decades are sensitive to emissions of short-lived compounds such as aerosols
and methane. More distant projections, however, are more sensitive to alternative scenarios around long-lived GHG
emissions. These scenario-dependent uncertainties will not be reduced by improvements in climate science, and will
become the dominant uncertainty in projections over longer timescales (e.g., 2100).
The final contribution to the uncertainty range comes from our imperfect knowledge of how the climate will
respond to future anthropogenic emissions and land use change. Scientists principally use computer-based global
climate models to estimate this response. A few dozen global climate models have been developed by different
groups of scientists around the world. All models are built on the same physical principles, but some approximations
are needed because the climate system is so complex. Different groups choose slightly different approximations
to represent specific processes in the atmosphere, such as clouds. These choices produce differences in climate
projections from different models. This contribution to the uncertainty range is described as ‘response uncertainty’
or ‘model uncertainty’.
The complexity of the Earth system means that future climate could follow many different scenarios, yet still
be consistent with current understanding and models. As observational records lengthen and models improve,
researchers should be able, within the limitations of the range of natural variability, to narrow that range in
probable temperature in the next few decades. It is also possible to use information about the
current state of the oceans and cryosphere to produce better projections up to a few years ahead.
As science improves, new geophysical processes can be added to climate models, and representations of those
already included can be improved. These developments can appear to increase model-derived estimates of climate
response uncertainty, but such increases merely reflect the quantification of previously unmeasured sources of
uncertainty. As more and more important processes are added, the influence of unquantified
processes lessens, and there can be more confidence in the projections.",a
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,How Do We Know the World Has Warmed?,q
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"Evidence for a warming world comes from multiple independent climate indicators, from high up in the atmosphere
to the depths of the oceans. They include changes in surface, atmospheric and oceanic temperatures; glaciers; snow
cover; sea ice; sea level and atmospheric water vapour. Scientists from all over the world have independently verified this evidence many times. That the world has warmed since the 19th century is unequivocal.
Discussion about climate warming often centres on potential residual biases in temperature records from landbased weather stations. These records are very important, but they only represent one indicator of changes in the
climate system. Broader evidence for a warming world comes from a wide range of independent physically consistent measurements of many other, strongly interlinked, elements of the climate system .
A rise in global average surface temperatures is the best-known indicator of climate change. Although each year and
even decade is not always warmer than the last, global surface temperatures have warmed substantially since 1900.
Warming land temperatures correspond closely with the observed warming trend over the oceans. Warming oceanic air temperatures, measured from aboard ships, and temperatures of the sea surface itself also coincide, as
borne out by many independent analyses.
The atmosphere and ocean are both fluid bodies, so warming at the surface should also be seen in the lower atmosphere, and deeper down into the upper oceans, and observations confirm that this is indeed the case. Analyses of
measurements made by weather balloon radiosondes and satellites consistently show warming of the troposphere,
the active weather layer of the atmosphere. More than 90% of the excess energy absorbed by the climate system
since at least the 1970s has been stored in the oceans as can be seen from global records of ocean heat content
going back to the 1950s. As the oceans warm, the water itself expands. This expansion is one of the main drivers of the independently
observed rise in sea levels over the past century. Melting of glaciers and ice sheets also contribute, as do changes in
storage and usage of water on land.
A warmer world is also a moister one, because warmer air can hold more water vapour. Global analyses show that
specific humidity, which measures the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, has increased over both the land
and the oceans.
The frozen parts of the planet—known collectively as the cryosphere—affect, and are affected by, local changes
in temperature. The amount of ice contained in glaciers globally has been declining every year for more than 20
years, and the lost mass contributes, in part, to the observed rise in sea level. Snow cover is sensitive to changes in
temperature, particularly during the spring, when snow starts to melt. Spring snow cover has shrunk across the NH
since the 1950s. Substantial losses in Arctic sea ice have been observed since satellite records began, particularly at
the time of the mimimum extent, which occurs in September at the end of the annual melt season. By contrast, the
increase in Antarctic sea ice has been smaller.
Individually, any single analysis might be unconvincing, but analysis of these different indicators and independent
data sets has led many independent research groups to all reach the same conclusion. From the deep oceans to the
top of the troposphere, the evidence of warmer air and oceans, of melting ice and rising seas all points unequivocally to one thing: the world has warmed since the late 19th century. ",a
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,Have There Been Any Changes in Climate Extremes?,q
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"There is strong evidence that warming has lead to changes in temperature extremes—including heat waves—since
the mid-20th century. Increases in heavy precipitation have probably also occurred over this time, but vary by
region. However, for other extremes, such as tropical cyclone frequency, we are less certain, except in some limited
regions, that there have been discernable changes over the observed record.
From heat waves to cold snaps or droughts to flooding rains, recording and analysing climate extremes poses
unique challenges, not just because these events are rare, but also because they invariably happen in conjunction
with disruptive conditions. Furthermore, there is no consistent definition in the scientific literature of what constitutes an extreme climatic event, and this complicates comparative global assessments.
Although, in an absolute sense, an extreme climate event will vary from place to place—a hot day in the tropics,
for instance, may be a different temperature to a hot day in the mid-latitudes—international efforts to monitor
extremes have highlighted some significant global changes.
For example, using consistent definitions for cold
(<10th percentile) and warm (>90th percentile) days
and nights it is found that warm days and nights have
increased and cold days and nights have decreased for
most regions of the globe; a few exceptions being central and eastern North America, and southern South
America but mostly only related to daytime temperatures. Those changes are generally most apparent in
minimum temperature extremes, for example, warm
nights. Data limitations make it difficult to establish
a causal link to increases in average temperatures,
but, indicates that daily global temperature extremes have indeed changed. Whether
these changes are simply associated with the average
of daily temperatures increasing  or whether other changes in the
distribution of daytime and nighttime temperatures
have occurred is still under debate.
Warm spells or heat waves, that is, periods containing consecutive extremely hot days or nights, have
also been assessed, but there are fewer studies of
heat wave characteristics than those that compare
changes in merely warm days or nights. Most global
land areas with available data have experienced more
heat waves since the middle of the 20th century. One
exception is the south-eastern USA, where heat wave
frequency and duration measures generally show
decreases. This has been associated with a so-called
‘warming hole’ in this region, where precipitation
has also increased and may be related to interactions
between the land and the atmosphere and long-term
variations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. However, for large regions, particularly in Africa and South
America, information on changes in heatwaves is
limited.
For regions such as Europe, where historical temperature reconstructions exist going back several hundreds of
years, indications are that some areas have experienced a disproportionate number of extreme heat waves in
recent decades. Changes in extremes for other climate variables are generally less coherent than those observed for temperature,
owing to data limitations and inconsistencies between studies, regions and/or seasons. However, increases in precipitation extremes, for example, are consistent with a warmer climate. Analyses of land areas with sufficient data
indicate increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events in recent decades, but results vary
strongly between regions and seasons. For instance, evidence is most compelling for increases in heavy precipitation
in North America, Central America and Europe, but in some other regions—such as southern Australia and western
Asia—there is evidence of decreases. Likewise, drought studies do not agree on the sign of the global trend, with
regional inconsistencies in trends also dependent on how droughts are defined. However, indications exist that
droughts have increased in some regions (e.g., the Mediterranean) and decreased in others (e.g., central North
America) since the middle of the 20th century.
Considering other extremes, such as tropical cyclones, the latest assessments show that due to problems with past
observing capabilities, it is difficult to make conclusive statements about long-term trends. There is very strong evidence, however, that storm activity has increased in the North Atlantic since the 1970s.
Over periods of a century or more, evidence suggests slight decreases in the frequency of tropical cyclones making
landfall in the North Atlantic and the South Pacific, once uncertainties in observing methods have been considered.
Little evidence exists of any longer-term trend in other ocean basins. For extratropical cyclones, a poleward shift is
evident in both hemispheres over the past 50 years, with further but limited evidence of a decrease in wind storm
frequency at mid-latitudes. Several studies suggest an increase in intensity, but data sampling issues hamper these
assessments.
 summarizes some of the observed changes in climate extremes. Overall, the most robust global
changes in climate extremes are seen in measures of daily temperature, including to some extent, heat waves.
Precipitation extremes also appear to be increasing, but there is large spatial variability, and observed trends in
droughts are still uncertain except in a few regions. While robust increases have been seen in tropical cyclone frequency and activity in the North Atlantic since the 1970s, the reasons for this are still being debated. There is limited
evidence of changes in extremes associated with other climate variables since the mid-20th century.",a
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,Is the Ocean Warming?,q
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"Yes, the ocean is warming over many regions, depth ranges and time periods, although neither everywhere nor
constantly. The signature of warming emerges most clearly when considering global, or even ocean basin, averages
over time spans of a decade or more.
Ocean temperature at any given location can vary greatly with the seasons. It can also fluctuate substantially
from year to year—or even decade to decade—because of variations in ocean currents and the exchange of heat
between ocean and atmosphere.
Ocean temperatures have been recorded for centuries, but it was not until around 1971 that measurements were
sufficiently comprehensive to estimate the average global temperature of the upper several hundred meters of
the ocean confidently for any given year. In fact, before the international Argo temperature/salinity profiling float
array first achieved worldwide coverage in 2005, the global average upper ocean temperature for any given year
was sensitive to the methodology used to estimate it.
Global mean upper ocean temperatures have increased over decadal time scales from 1971 to 2010. Despite large
uncertainty in most yearly means, this warming is a robust result. In the upper 75 m of the ocean, the global average
warming trend has been 0.11 [0.09 to 0.13]°C per decade over this time. That trend generally lessens from the
surface to mid-depth, reducing to about 0.04°C per decade by 200 m, and to less than 0.02°C per decade by 500 m.
Temperature anomalies enter the subsurface ocean by paths in addition to mixing from above . Colder—hence denser—waters from high latitudes can sink from the surface, then spread toward the equator
beneath warmer, lighter, waters at lower latitudes. At a few locations—the northern North Atlantic Ocean and the
Southern Ocean around Antarctica—ocean water is cooled so much that it sinks to great depths, even to the sea
floor. This water then spreads out to fill much of the rest of the deep ocean. As ocean surface waters warm, these
sinking waters also warm with time, increasing temperatures in the ocean interior much more quickly than would
downward mixing of surface heating alone.
In the North Atlantic, the temperature of these deep waters varies from decade to decade—sometimes warming,
sometimes cooling—depending on prevailing winter atmospheric patterns. Around Antarctica, bottom waters have
warmed detectably from about 1992–2005, perhaps due to the strengthening and southward shift of westerly
winds around the Southern Ocean over the last several decades. This warming signal in the deepest coldest bottom
waters of the world ocean is detectable, although it weakens northward in the Indian, Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
Deep warming rates are generally less pronounced than ocean surface rates (around 0.03ºC per decade since the
1990s in the deep and bottom waters around Antarctica, and smaller in many other locations). However, they occur
over a large volume, so deep ocean warming contributes significantly to the total increase in ocean heat.
Estimates of historical changes in global average ocean temperature have become more accurate over the past
several years, largely thanks to the recognition, and reduction, of systematic measurement errors. By carefully
comparing less accurate measurements with sparser, more accurate ones at adjacent locations and similar times,
scientists have reduced some spurious instrumental biases in the historical record. These improvements revealed
that the global average ocean temperature has increased much more steadily from year to year than was reported
prior to 2008. Nevertheless, the global average warming rate may not be uniform in time. In some years, the ocean
appears to warm faster than average; in others, the warming rate seems to slow.
The ocean’s large mass and high heat capacity allow it to store huge amounts of energy—more than 1000 times
that in the atmosphere for an equivalent increase in temperature. The Earth is absorbing more heat than it is
emitting back into space, and nearly all this excess heat is entering the oceans and being stored there. The ocean
has absorbed about 93% of the combined heat stored by warmed air, sea, and land, and melted ice between 1971
and 2010.
The ocean’s huge heat capacity and slow circulation lend it significant thermal inertia. It takes about a decade
for near-surface ocean temperatures to adjust in response to climate forcing , such as changes in
greenhouse gas concentrations. Thus, if greenhouse gas concentrations could be held at present levels into the
future, increases in the Earth’s surface temperature would begin to slow within about a decade. However, deep
ocean temperature would continue to warm for centuries to millennia, and thus sea levels would
continue to rise for centuries to millennia as well.",a
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,Is There Evidence for Changes in the Earth’s Water Cycle?,q
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"The Earth’s water cycle involves evaporation and precipitation of moisture at the Earth’s surface. Changes in the
atmosphere’s water vapour content provide strong evidence that the water cycle is already responding to a warming
climate. Further evidence comes from changes in the distribution of ocean salinity, which, due to a lack of long-term
observations of rain and evaporation over the global oceans, has become an important proxy rain gauge.
The water cycle is expected to intensify in a warmer climate, because warmer air can be moister: the atmosphere can
hold about 7% more water vapour for each degree Celsius of warming. Observations since the 1970s show increases
in surface and lower atmospheric water vapour (FAQ 3.2, Figure 1a), at a rate consistent with observed warming.
Moreover, evaporation and precipitation are projected to intensify in a warmer climate.
Recorded changes in ocean salinity in the last 50 years support that projection. Seawater contains both salt and
fresh water, and its salinity is a function of the weight of dissolved salts it contains. Because the total amount of
salt—which comes from the weathering of rocks—does not change over human time scales, seawater’s salinity can
only be altered—over days or centuries—by the addition or removal of fresh water.
The atmosphere connects the ocean’s regions of net fresh water loss to those of fresh water gain by moving
evaporated water vapour from one place to another. The distribution of salinity at the ocean surface largely reflects
the spatial pattern of evaporation minus precipitation, runoff from land, and sea ice processes. There is some
shifting of the patterns relative to each other, because of the ocean’s currents.
Subtropical waters are highly saline, because evaporation exceeds rainfall, whereas seawater at high latitudes
and in the tropics—where more rain falls than evaporates—is less so. The Atlantic, the
saltiest ocean basin, loses more freshwater through evaporation than it gains from precipitation, while the Pacific
is nearly neutral (i.e., precipitation gain nearly balances evaporation loss), and the Southern Ocean (region around
Antarctica) is dominated by precipitation.
Changes in surface salinity and in the upper ocean have reinforced the mean salinity pattern. The evaporationdominated subtropical regions have become saltier, while the precipitation-dominated subpolar and tropical regions
have become fresher. When changes over the top 500 m are considered, the evaporation-dominated Atlantic has
become saltier, while the nearly neutral Pacific and precipitation-dominated Southern Ocean have become fresher.
Observing changes in precipitation and evaporation directly and globally is difficult, because most of the exchange
of fresh water between the atmosphere and the surface happens over the 70% of the Earth’s surface covered
by ocean. Long-term precipitation records are available only from over the land, and there are no long-term
measurements of evaporation.
Land-based observations show precipitation increases in some regions, and decreases in others, making it difficult
to construct a globally integrated picture. Land-based observations have shown more extreme rainfall events, and
more flooding associated with earlier snow melt at high northern latitudes, but there is strong regionality in the
trends. Land-based observations are so far insufficient to provide evidence of changes in drought.
Ocean salinity, on the other hand, acts as a sensitive and effective rain gauge over the ocean. It naturally reflects
and smoothes out the difference between water gained by the ocean from precipitation, and water lost by the
ocean through evaporation, both of which are very patchy and episodic. Ocean salinity is also affected by water
runoff from the continents, and by the melting and freezing of sea ice or floating glacial ice. Fresh water added by
melting ice on land will change global-averaged salinity, but changes to date are too small to observe.
Data from the past 50 years show widespread salinity changes in the upper ocean, which are indicative of systematic
changes in precipitation and runoff minus evaporation.",a
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,How Does Anthropogenic Ocean Acidification Relate to Climate Change?,q
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"Both anthropogenic climate change and anthropogenic ocean acidification are caused by increasing carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. Rising levels of carbon dioxide (CO2), along with other greenhouse gases, indirectly alter the climate system by trapping heat as it is reflected back from the Earth’s surface. Anthropogenic ocean acidification is a direct consequence of rising CO2 concentrations as seawater currently absorbs about 30% of the anthropogenic CO2 from the atmosphere. Ocean acidification refers to a reduction in pH over an extended period, typically decades or longer, caused primarily by the uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere. pH is a dimensionless measure of acidity. Ocean acidification describes the direction of pH change rather than the end point; that is, ocean pH is decreasing but is not expected to become acidic (pH < 7). Ocean acidification can also be caused by other chemical additions or subtractions from the oceans that are natural (e.g., increased volcanic activity, methane hydrate releases, long-term changes in net respiration) or human-induced (e.g., release of nitrogen and sulphur compounds into the atmosphere). Anthropogenic ocean acidification refers to the component of pH reduction that is caused by human activity. Since about 1750, the release of CO2 from industrial and agricultural activities has resulted in global average atmospheric CO2 concentrations that have increased from 278 to 390.5 ppm in 2011. The atmospheric concentration of CO2 is now higher than experienced on the Earth for at least the last 800,000 years and is expected to continue to rise because of our dependence on fossil fuels for energy. To date, the oceans have absorbed approximately 155 ± 30 PgC from the atmosphere, which corresponds to roughly one-fourth of the total amount of CO2 emitted (555 ± 85 PgC) by human activities since preindustrial times. This natural process of absorption has significantly reduced the greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere and minimized some of the impacts of global warming. However, the ocean’s uptake of CO2 is having a significant impact on the chemistry of seawater. The average pH of ocean surface waters has already fallen by about 0.1 units, from about 8.2 to 8.1 since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Estimates of projected future atmospheric and oceanic CO2 concentrations indicate that, by the end of this century, the average surface ocean pH could be 0.2 to 0.4 lower than it is today. The pH scale is logarithmic, so a change of 1 unit corresponds to a 10-fold change in hydrogen ion concentration. When atmospheric CO2 exchanges across the air–sea interface it reacts with seawater through a series of four chemical reactions that increase the concentrations of the carbon species: dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2(aq)), carbonic acid (H2CO3) and bicarbonate (HCO3 –).Hydrogen ions (H+) are produced by these reactions. This increase in the ocean’s hydrogen ion concentration corresponds to a reduction in pH, or an increase in acidity. Under normal seawater conditions, more than 99.99% of
the hydrogen ions that are produced will combine with carbonate ion (CO3
2– ) to produce additional HCO3
–. Thus,
the addition of anthropogenic CO2 into the oceans lowers the pH and consumes carbonate ion. These reactions are
fully reversible and the basic thermodynamics of these reactions in seawater are well known, such that at a pH of
approximately 8.1 approximately 90% the carbon is in the form of bicarbonate ion, 9% in the form of carbonate
ion, and only about 1% of the carbon is in the form of dissolved CO2. Results from laboratory, field, and modeling
studies, as well as evidence from the geological record, clearly indicate that marine ecosystems are highly susceptible to the increases in oceanic CO2 and the corresponding decreases in pH and carbonate ion.
Climate change and anthropogenic ocean acidification do not act independently. Although the CO2 that is taken up
by the ocean does not contribute to greenhouse warming, ocean warming reduces the solubility of carbon dioxide
in seawater; and thus reduces the amount of CO2 the oceans can absorb from the atmosphere. For example, under
doubled preindustrial CO2 concentrations and a 2°C temperature increase, seawater absorbs about 10% less CO2
(10% less total carbon, CT) than it would with no temperature increase (compare columns 4 and 6 in Table 1), but
the pH remains almost unchanged. Thus, a warmer ocean has less capacity to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, yet
still experiences ocean acidification. The reason for this is that bicarbonate is converted to carbonate in a warmer
ocean, releasing a hydrogen ion thus stabilizing the pH. (",a
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,How Is Sea Ice Changing in the Arctic and Antarctic?,q
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"The sea ice covers on the Arctic Ocean and on the Southern Ocean around Antarctica have quite different characteristics, and are showing different changes with time. Over the past 34 years (1979–2012), there has been a downward trend of 3.8% per decade in the annual average extent of sea ice in the Arctic. The average winter thickness
of Arctic Ocean sea ice has thinned by approximately 1.8 m between 1978 and 2008, and the total volume (mass)
of Arctic sea ice has decreased at all times of year. The more rapid decrease in the extent of sea ice at the summer
minimum is a consequence of these trends. In contrast, over the same 34-year period, the total extent of Antarctic
sea ice shows a small increase of 1.5% per decade, but there are strong regional differences in the changes around
the Antarctic. Measurements of Antarctic sea ice thickness are too few to be able to judge whether its total volume
(mass) is decreasing, steady, or increasing.
A large part of the total Arctic sea ice cover lies above 60°N  and is surrounded by land to the
south with openings to the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, and the Bering, Barents and Greenland seas. Some of the
ice within the Arctic Basin survives for several seasons, growing in thickness by freezing of seawater at the base and
by deformation (ridging and rafting). Seasonal sea ice grows to only ~2 m in thickness but sea ice that is more than
1 year old (perennial ice) can be several metres thicker. Arctic sea ice drifts within the basin, driven by wind and
ocean currents: the mean drift pattern is dominated by a clockwise circulation pattern in the western Arctic and a
Transpolar Drift Stream that transports Siberian sea ice across the Arctic and exports it from the basin through the
Fram Strait.
Satellites with the capability to distinguish ice and open water have provided a picture of the sea ice cover changes.
Since 1979, the annual average extent of ice in the Arctic has decreased by 3.8% per decade. The decline in extent
at the end of summer (in late September) has been even greater at 11% per decade, reaching a record minimum in
2012. The decadal average extent of the September minimum Arctic ice cover has decreased for each decade since
satellite records began. Submarine and satellite records suggest that the thickness of Arctic ice, and hence the total
volume, is also decreasing. Changes in the relative amounts of perennial and seasonal ice are contributing to the
reduction in ice volume. Over the 34-year record, approximately 17% of this type of sea ice per decade has been lost
to melt and export out of the basin since 1979 and 40% since 1999. Although the area of Arctic sea ice coverage can
fluctuate from year to year because of variable seasonal production, the proportion of thick perennial ice, and the
total sea ice volume, can recover only slowly.
Unlike the Arctic, the sea ice cover around Antarctica is constrained to latitudes north of 78°S because of the presence of the continental land mass. The Antarctic sea ice cover is largely seasonal, with an average thickness of
only ~1 m at the time of maximum extent in September. Only a small fraction of the ice cover survives the summer
minimum in February, and very little Antarctic sea ice is more than 2 years old. The ice edge is exposed to the open
ocean and the snowfall rate over Antarctic sea ice is higher than in the Arctic. When the snow load from snowfall is
sufficient to depress the ice surface below sea level, seawater infiltrates the base of the snow pack and snow-ice is
formed when the resultant slush freezes. Consequently, snow-to-ice conversion (as well as basal freezing as in the
Arctic) contributes to the seasonal growth in ice thickness and total ice volume in the Antarctic. Snow-ice formation is sensitive to changes in precipitation and thus changes in regional climate. The consequence of changes in
precipitation on Antarctic sea ice thickness and volume remains a focus for research.
Unconstrained by land boundaries, the latitudinal extent of the Antarctic sea ice cover is highly variable. Near the
Antarctic coast, sea ice drift is predominantly from east to west, but further north, it is from west to east and highly
divergent. Distinct clockwise circulation patterns that transport ice northward can be found in the Weddell and
Ross seas, while the circulation is more variable around East Antarctica. The northward extent of the sea ice cover is
controlled in part by the divergent drift that is conducive in winter months to new ice formation in persistent open
water areas (polynyas) along the coastlines. These zones of ice formation result in saltier and thus denser ocean
water and become one of the primary sources of the deepest water found in the global oceans.
Over the same 34-year satellite record, the annual extent of sea ice in the Antarctic increased at about 1.5% per
decade. However, there are regional differences in trends, with decreases seen in the Bellingshausen and Amundsen
seas, but a larger increase in sea ice extent in the Ross Sea that dominates the overall trend. Whether the smaller
overall increase in Antarctic sea ice extent is meaningful as an indicator of climate is uncertain because the extent varies so much from year to year and from place to place around the continent. Results from a recent study suggest
that these contrasting trends in ice coverage may be due to trends in regional wind speed and patterns. Without
better ice thickness and ice volume estimates, it is difficult to characterize how Antarctic sea ice cover is responding
to changing climate, or which climate parameters are most influential.
There are large differences in the physical environment and processes that affect the state of Arctic and Antarctic
sea ice cover and contribute to their dissimilar responses to climate change. The long, and unbroken, record of
satellite observations have provided a clear picture of the decline of the Arctic sea ice cover, but available evidence
precludes us from making robust statements about overall changes in Antarctic sea ice and their causes.",a

https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"In many mountain ranges around the world, glaciers are disappearing in response to the atmospheric temperature
increases of past decades. Disappearing glaciers have been reported in the Canadian Arctic and Rocky Mountains;
the Andes; Patagonia; the European Alps; the Tien Shan; tropical mountains in South America, Africa and Asia and
elsewhere. In these regions, more than 600 glaciers have disappeared over the past decades. Even if there is no
further warming, many more glaciers will disappear. It is also likely that some mountain ranges will lose most, if not
all, of their glaciers.
In all mountain regions where glaciers exist today, glacier volume has decreased considerably over the past 150
years. Over that time, many small glaciers have disappeared. With some local exceptions, glacier shrinkage (area
and volume reduction) was globally widespread already and particularly strong during the 1940s and since the
1980s. However, there were also phases of relative stability during the 1890s, 1920s and 1970s, as indicated by longterm measurements of length changes and by modelling of mass balance. Conventional in situ measurements—and
increasingly, airborne and satellite measurements—offer robust evidence in most glacierized regions that the rate
of reduction in glacier area was higher over the past two decades than previously, and that glaciers continue to
shrink. In a few regions, however, individual glaciers are behaving differently and have advanced while most others
were in retreat (e.g., on the coasts of New Zealand, Norway and Southern Patagonia (Chile), or in the Karakoram
range in Asia). In general, these advances are the result of special topographic and/or climate conditions (e.g.,
increased precipitation).
It can take several decades for a glacier to adjust its extent to an instantaneous change in climate, so most glaciers
are currently larger than they would be if they were in balance with current climate. Because the time required for
the adjustment increases with glacier size, larger glaciers will continue to shrink over the next few decades, even if
temperatures stabilise. Smaller glaciers will also continue to shrink, but they will adjust their extent faster and many
will ultimately disappear entirely.
Many factors influence the future development of each glacier, and whether it will disappear: for instance, its size,
slope, elevation range, distribution of area with elevation, and its surface characteristics (e.g., the amount of debris
cover). These factors vary substantially from region to region, and also between neighbouring glaciers. External factors, such as the surrounding topography and the climatic regime, are also important for future glacier evolution.
Over shorter time scales (one or two decades), each glacier responds to climate change individually and differently
in detail.
Over periods longer than about 50 years, the response is more coherent and less dependent on local environmental
details, which means that long-term trends in glacier development can be well modelled. Such models are built
on an understanding of basic physical principles. For example, an increase in local mean air temperature, with no
change in precipitation, will cause an upward shift of the equilibrium line altitude (ELA; see Glossary) by about 150
m for each degree Celsius of atmospheric warming. Such an upward shift and its consequences for glaciers of different size and elevation range are illustrated.
Initially, all glaciers have an accumulation area (white) above and an ablation area (light blue) below the ELA
. As the ELA shifts upwards, the accumulation area shrinks and the ablation area expands, thus
increasing the area over which ice is lost through melt. This imbalance results in an overall loss
of ice. After several years, the glacier front retreats, and the ablation area shrinks until the glacier has adjusted its
extent to the new climate. Where climate change is sufficiently strong to raise the ELA permanently above the glacier’s highest point (FAQ 4.2, Figure 1b, right) the glacier will eventually disappear entirely
(FAQ 4.2, Figure 1c, right). Higher glaciers, which retain their accumulation areas, will shrink but not disappear (FAQ
4.2, Figure 1c, left and middle). A large valley glacier might lose much of its tongue, probably leaving a lake in its
place (FAQ 4.2, Figure 1c, left). Besides air temperature, changes in the quantity and seasonality of precipitation
influence the shift of the ELA as well. Glacier dynamics (e.g., flow speed) also plays a role, but is not considered in
this simplified scheme.
Many observations have confirmed that different glacier types do respond differently to recent climate change.
For example, the flat, low-lying tongues of large valley glaciers (such as in Alaska, Canada or the Alps) currently
show the strongest mass losses, largely independent of aspect, shading or debris cover. This type of glacier is slow in adjusting its extent to new climatic conditions
and reacts mainly by thinning without substantial terminus retreat. In contrast, smaller mountain glaciers, with fairly constant slopes, adjust
more quickly to the new climate by changing
the size of their ablation area more rapidly
(FAQ 4.2, Figure 1c, middle).
The long-term response of most glacier types
can be determined very well with the approach
illustrated in FAQ 4.2, Figure 1. However, modelling short-term glacier response, or the longterm response of more complex glacier types
(e.g., those that are heavily debris-covered, fed
by avalanche snow, have a disconnected accumulation area, are of surging type, or calve into
water), is difficult. These cases require detailed
knowledge of other glacier characteristics, such
as mass balance, ice thickness distribution, and
internal hydraulics. For the majority of glaciers
worldwide, such data are unavailable, and
their response to climate change can thus only
be approximated with the simplified scheme
shown in FAQ 4.2, Figure 1.
The Karakoram–Himalaya mountain range, for
instance, has a large variety of glacier types
and climatic conditions, and glacier characteristics are still only poorly known. This makes
determining their future evolution particularly
uncertain. However, gaps in knowledge are
expected to decrease substantially in coming
years, thanks to increased use of satellite data
(e.g., to compile glacier inventories or derive
flow velocities) and extension of the groundbased measurement network.
In summary, the fate of glaciers will be variable,
depending on both their specific characteristics
and future climate conditions. More glaciers
will disappear; others will lose most of their low-lying portions and others might not change substantially. Where
the ELA is already above the highest elevation on a particular glacier, that glacier is destined to disappear entirely
unless climate cools. Similarly, all glaciers will disappear in those regions where the ELA rises above their highest
elevation in the future.",a
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,Is the Sun a Major Driver of Recent Changes in Climate?,q
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"Total solar irradiance (TSI, Chapter 8) is a measure of the total energy received from the sun at the top of the atmosphere. It varies over a wide range of time scales, from billions of years to just a few days, though variations have
been relatively small over the past 140 years. Changes in solar irradiance are an important driver of climate variability (Chapter 1; Figure 1.1) along with volcanic emissions and anthropogenic factors. As such, they help explain
the observed change in global surface temperatures during the instrumental period (FAQ 5.1, Figure 1; Chapter 10)
and over the last millennium. While solar variability may have had a discernible contribution to changes in global
surface temperature in the early 20th century, it cannot explain the observed increase since TSI started to be measured directly by satellites in the late 1970s (Chapters 8, 10).
The Sun’s core is a massive nuclear fusion reactor that converts hydrogen into helium. This process produces energy
that radiates throughout the solar system as electromagnetic radiation. The amount of energy striking the top of
Earth’s atmosphere varies depending on the generation and emission of electromagnetic energy by the Sun and on
the Earth’s orbital path around the Sun.
Satellite-based instruments have directly measured TSI since 1978, and indicate that on average, ~1361 W m–2 reaches the top of the Earth’s atmosphere. Parts of the Earth’s surface and air pollution and clouds in the atmosphere act
as a mirror and reflect about 30% of this power back into space. Higher levels of TSI are recorded when the Sun is
more active. Irradiance variations follow the roughly 11-year sunspot cycle: during the last cycles, TSI values fluctuated by an average of around 0.1%.
For pre-satellite times, TSI variations have to be estimated from sunspot numbers (back to 1610), or from radioisotopes that are formed in the atmosphere, and archived in polar ice and tree rings. Distinct 50- to 100-year periods
of very low solar activity—such as the Maunder Minimum between 1645 and 1715—are commonly referred to as
grand solar minima. Most estimates of TSI changes between the Maunder Minimum and the present day are in the
order of 0.1%, similar to the amplitude of the 11-year variability.
How can solar variability help explain the observed global surface temperature record back to 1870? To answer
this question, it is important to understand that other climate drivers are involved, each producing characteristic
patterns of regional climate responses. However, it is the combination of them all that causes the observed climate
change. Solar variability and volcanic eruptions are natural factors. Anthropogenic (human-produced) factors, on
the other hand, include changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, and emissions of visible air pollution
(aerosols) and other substances from human activities. ‘Internal variability’ refers to fluctuations within the climate
system, for example, due to weather variability or phenomena like the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.
The relative contributions of these natural and anthropogenic factors change with time. FAQ 5.1, Figure 1 illustrates
those contributions based on a very simple calculation, in which the mean global surface temperature variation represents the sum of four components linearly related to solar, volcanic, and anthropogenic forcing, and to internal
variability. Global surface temperature has increased by approximately 0.8°C from 1870 to 2010 (FAQ 5.1, Figure
1a). However, this increase has not been uniform: at times, factors that cool the Earth’s surface—volcanic eruptions,
reduced solar activity, most anthropogenic aerosol emissions—have outweighed those factors that warm it, such
as greenhouse gases, and the variability generated within the climate system has caused further fluctuations unrelated to external influences.
The solar contribution to the record of global surface temperature change is dominated by the 11-year solar cycle,
which can explain global temperature fluctuations up to approximately 0.1°C between minima and maxima (FAQ
5.1, Figure 1b). A long-term increasing trend in solar activity in the early 20th century may have augmented the
warming recorded during this interval, together with internal variability, greenhouse gas increases and a hiatus
in volcanism. However, it cannot explain the observed increase since the late 1970s, and there was even a slight
decreasing trend of TSI from 1986 to 2008 (Chapters 8 and 10).
Volcanic eruptions contribute to global surface temperature change by episodically injecting aerosols into the
atmosphere, which cool the Earth’s surface (FAQ 5.1, Figure 1c). Large volcanic eruptions, such as the eruption of
Mt. Pinatubo in 1991, can cool the surface by around 0.1°C to 0.3°C for up to three years. The most important component of internal climate variability is the El Niño Southern Oscillation,
which has a major effect on year-to-year variations
of tropical and global mean temperature (FAQ 5.1,
Figure 1d). Relatively high annual temperatures
have been encountered during El Niño events, such
as in 1997–1998.
The variability of observed global surface temperatures from 1870 to 2010 (Figure 1a) reflects the combined influences of natural (solar, volcanic, internal;
FAQ 5.1, Figure 1b–d) factors, superimposed on the
multi-decadal warming trend from anthropogenic
factors (FAQ 5.1, Figure 1e).
Prior to 1870, when anthropogenic emissions
of greenhouse gases and aerosols were smaller,
changes in solar and volcanic activity and internal
variability played a more important role, although
the specific contributions of these individual factors to global surface temperatures are less certain.
Solar minima lasting several decades have often
been associated with cold conditions. However,
these periods are often also affected by volcanic
eruptions, making it difficult to quantify the solar
contribution.
At the regional scale, changes in solar activity have
been related to changes in surface climate and
atmospheric circulation in the Indo-Pacific, Northern Asia and North Atlantic areas. The mechanisms
that amplify the regional effects of the relatively
small fluctuations of TSI in the roughly 11-year solar
cycle involve dynamical interactions between the
upper and the lower atmosphere, or between the
ocean sea surface temperature and atmosphere,
and have little effect on global mean temperatures
(see Box 10.2).
Finally, a decrease in solar activity during the past
solar minimum a few years ago (FAQ 5.1, Figure
1b) raises the question of its future influence on
climate. Despite uncertainties in future solar activity, there is high confidence that the effects of solar
activity within the range of grand solar maxima and
minima will be much smaller than the changes due
to anthropogenic effects.",a
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,How Unusual is the Current Sea Level Rate of Change?,q
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"The rate of mean global sea level change—averaging 1.7 ± 0.2 mm yr–1 for the entire 20th century and between
2.8 and 3.6 mm yr–1 since 1993 (Chapter 13)—is unusual in the context of centennial-scale variations of the last two
millennia. However, much more rapid rates of sea level change occurred during past periods of rapid ice sheet disintegration, such as transitions between glacial and interglacial periods. Exceptional tectonic effects can also drive
very rapid local sea level changes, with local rates exceeding the current global rates of change.
‘Sea level’ is commonly thought of as the point where the ocean meets the land. Earth scientists define sea level as a
measure of the position of the sea surface relative to the land, both of which may be moving relative to the center
of the Earth. A measure of sea level therefore reflects a combination of geophysical and climate factors. Geophysical factors affecting sea level include land subsidence or uplift and glacial isostatic adjustments—the earth–ocean
system’s response to changes in mass distribution on the Earth, specifically ocean water and land ice.
Climate influences include variations in ocean temperatures, which cause sea water to expand or contract, changes
in the volume of glaciers and ice sheets, and shifts in ocean currents. Local and regional changes in these climate
and geophysical factors produce significant deviations from the global estimate of the mean rate of sea level
change. For example, local sea level is falling at a rate approaching 10 mm yr–1 along the northern Swedish coast
(Gulf of Bothnia), due to ongoing uplift caused by continental ice that melted after the last glacial period. In contrast, local sea level rose at a rate of ~20 mm yr–1 from 1960 to 2005 south of Bangkok, mainly in response to subsidence due to ground water extraction.
For the past ~150 years, sea level change has been recorded at tide gauge stations, and for the past ~20 years, with
satellite altimeters. Results of these two data sets are consistent for the overlapping period. The globally averaged
rate of sea level rise of ~1.7 ± 0.2 mm yr–1 over the 20th century—and about twice that over the past two decades—
may seem small compared with observations of wave and tidal oscillations around the globe that can be orders of
magnitude larger. However, if these rates persist over long time intervals, the magnitude carries important consequences for heavily populated, low-lying coastal regions, where even a small increase in sea level can inundate
large land areas.
Prior to the instrumental period, local rates of sea level change are estimated from indirect measures recorded
in sedimentary, fossil and archaeological archives. These proxy records are spatially limited and reflect both local
and global conditions. Reconstruction of a global signal is strengthened, though, when individual proxy records
from widely different environmental settings converge on a common signal. It is important to note that geologic
archives—particularly those before about 20,000 years ago—most commonly only capture millennial-scale changes
in sea level. Estimates of century-scale rates of sea level change are therefore based on millennial-scale information,
but it must be recognised that such data do not necessarily preclude more rapid rates of century-scale changes in
sea level.
Sea level reconstructions for the last two millennia offer an opportunity to use proxy records to overlap with, and
extend beyond, the instrumental period. A recent example comes from salt-marsh deposits on the Atlantic Coast
of the United States, combined with sea level reconstructions based on tide-gauge data and model predictions, to
document an average rate of sea level change since the late 19th century of 2.1 ± 0.2 mm yr–1. This century-long rise
exceeds any other century-scale change rate in the entire 2000-year record for this same section of coast.
On longer time scales, much larger rates and amplitudes of sea level changes have sometimes been encountered.
Glacial–interglacial climate cycles over the past 500,000 years resulted in global sea level changes of up to about 120
to 140 m. Much of this sea level change occurred in 10,000 to 15,000 years, during the transition from a full glacial
period to an interglacial period, at average rates of 10 to 15 mm yr–1. These high rates are only sustainable when
the Earth is emerging from periods of extreme glaciation, when large ice sheets contact the oceans. For example,
during the transition from the last glacial maximum (about 21,000 years ago) to the present interglacial (Holocene,
last 11,650 years), fossil coral reef deposits indicate that global sea level rose abruptly by 14 to 18 m in less than 500
years. This event is known as Meltwater Pulse 1A, in which the rate of sea level rise reached more than 40 mm yr–1.
These examples from longer time scales indicate rates of sea level change greater than observed today, but it should
be remembered that they all occurred in special circumstances: at times of transition from full glacial to interglacial condition; at locations where the long-term after-effects of these transitions are still occurring; at locations of major tectonic upheavals or in major deltas, where subsidence due to sediment compaction—sometimes amplified
by ground-fluid extraction—dominates.
The instrumental and geologic record support the conclusion that the current rate of mean global sea level change
is unusual relative to that observed and/or estimated over the last two millennia. Higher rates have been observed
in the geological record, especially during times of transition between glacial and interglacial periods.",a
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,Could Rapid Release of Methane and Carbon Dioxide from Thawing Permafrost or Ocean Warming Substantially Increase Warming?,q
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"Permafrost is permanently frozen ground, mainly found in the high latitudes of the Arctic. Permafrost, including
the sub-sea permafrost on the shallow shelves of the Arctic Ocean, contains old organic carbon deposits. Some are
relicts from the last glaciation, and hold at least twice the amount of carbon currently present in the atmosphere as
carbon dioxide (CO2). Should a sizeable fraction of this carbon be released as methane and CO2, it would increase
atmospheric concentrations, which would lead to higher atmospheric temperatures. That in turn would cause yet
more methane and CO2 to be released, creating a positive feedback, which would further amplify global warming.
The Arctic domain presently represents a net sink of CO2—sequestering around 0.4 ± 0.4 PgC yr–1 in growing vegetation representing about 10% of the current global land sink. It is also a modest source of methane (CH4): between
15 and 50 Tg(CH4) yr–1 are emitted mostly from seasonally unfrozen wetlands corresponding to about 10% of the
global wetland methane source. There is no clear evidence yet that thawing contributes significantly to the current
global budgets of these two greenhouse gases. However, under sustained Arctic warming, modelling studies and
expert judgments indicate with medium agreement that a potential combined release totalling up to 350 PgC as
CO2 equivalent could occur by the year 2100.
Permafrost soils on land, and in ocean shelves, contain large pools of organic carbon, which must be
thawed and decomposed by microbes before it can
be released—mostly as CO2. Where oxygen is limited,
as in waterlogged soils, some microbes also produce
methane.
On land, permafrost is overlain by a surface ‘active
layer’, which thaws during summer and forms part of
the tundra ecosystem. If spring and summer temperatures become warmer on average, the active layer will
thicken, making more organic carbon available for
microbial decomposition. However, warmer summers
would also result in greater uptake of carbon dioxide by Arctic vegetation through photosynthesis. That
means the net Arctic carbon balance is a delicate one
between enhanced uptake and enhanced release of
carbon.
Hydrological conditions during the summer thaw are
also important. The melting of bodies of excess ground
ice may create standing water conditions in pools and
lakes, where lack of oxygen will induce methane production. The complexity of Arctic landscapes under
climate warming means we have low confidence in
which of these different processes might dominate on
a regional scale. Heat diffusion and permafrost melting takes time—in fact, the deeper Arctic permafrost can be seen as a relict of the last glaciation, which is still slowly
eroding—so any significant loss of permafrost soil carbon will happen over long time scales.
Given enough oxygen, decomposition of organic matter in soil is accompanied by the release of heat by microbes
(similar to compost), which, during summer, might stimulate further permafrost thaw. Depending on carbon and
ice content of the permafrost, and the hydrological regime, this mechanism could, under warming, trigger relatively fast local permafrost degradation. Modelling studies of permafrost dynamics and greenhouse gas emissions indicate a relatively slow positive feedback, on time scales of hundreds of years. Until the year 2100, up to 250 PgC could be released as CO2, and up to
5 Pg as CH4. Given methane’s stronger greenhouse warming potential, that corresponds to a further 100 PgC of
equivalent CO2 released until the year 2100. These amounts are similar in magnitude to other biogeochemical feedbacks, for example, the additional CO2 released by the global warming of terrestrial soils. However, current models
do not include the full complexity of Arctic processes that occur when permafrost thaws, such as the formation of
lakes and ponds.
Methane hydrates are another form of frozen carbon, occurring in deep permafrost soils, ocean shelves, shelf slopes
and deeper ocean bottom sediments. They consist of methane and water molecule clusters, which are only stable in
a specific window of low temperatures and high pressures. On land and in the ocean, most of these hydrates originate from marine or terrestrial biogenic carbon, decomposed in the absence of oxygen and trapped in an aquatic
environment under suitable temperature–pressure conditions.
Any warming of permafrost soils, ocean waters and sediments and/or changes in pressure could destabilise those
hydrates, releasing their CH4 to the ocean. During larger, more sporadic releases, a fraction of that CH4 might also
be outgassed to the atmosphere. There is a large pool of these hydrates: in the Arctic alone, the amount of CH4
stored as hydrates could be more than 10 times greater than the CH4 presently in the global atmosphere.
Like permafrost thawing, liberating hydrates on land is a slow process, taking decades to centuries. The deeper
ocean regions and bottom sediments will take still longer—between centuries and millennia to warm enough to
destabilise the hydrates within them. Furthermore, methane released in deeper waters has to reach the surface
and atmosphere before it can become climatically active, but most is expected to be consumed by microorganisms
before it gets there. Only the CH4 from hydrates in shallow shelves, such as in the Arctic Ocean north of Eastern
Siberia, may actually reach the atmosphere to have a climate impact.
Several recent studies have documented locally significant CH4 emissions over the Arctic Siberian shelf and from
Siberian lakes. How much of this CH4 originates from decomposing organic carbon or from destabilizing hydrates is
not known. There is also no evidence available to determine whether these sources have been stimulated by recent
regional warming, or whether they have always existed—it may be possible that these CH4 seepages have been
present since the last deglaciation. In any event, these sources make a very small contribution to the global CH4
budget—less than 5%. This is also confirmed by atmospheric methane concentration observations, which do not
show any substantial increases over the Arctic.
However modelling studies and expert judgment indicate that CH4 and CO2 emissions will increase under Arctic
warming, and that they will provide a positive climate feedback. Over centuries, this feedback will be moderate: of
a magnitude similar to other climate–terrestrial ecosystem feedbacks. Over millennia and longer, however, CO2 and
CH4 releases from permafrost and shelves/shelf slopes are much more important, because of the large carbon and
methane hydrate pools involved.",a
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,What Happens to Carbon Dioxide After It Is Emitted into the Atmosphere?,q
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"Carbon dioxide (CO2), after it is emitted into the atmosphere, is firstly rapidly distributed between atmosphere, the
upper ocean and vegetation. Subsequently, the carbon continues to be moved between the different reservoirs
of the global carbon cycle, such as soils, the deeper ocean and rocks. Some of these exchanges occur very slowly.
Depending on the amount of CO2 released, between 15% and 40% will remain in the atmosphere for up to 2000
years, after which a new balance is established between the atmosphere, the land biosphere and the ocean. Geological processes will take anywhere from tens to hundreds of thousands of years—perhaps longer—to redistribute
the carbon further among the geological reservoirs. Higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and associated climate
impacts of present emissions, will, therefore, persist for a very long time into the future.
CO2 is a largely non-reactive gas, which is rapidly mixed throughout the entire troposphere in less than a year.
Unlike reactive chemical compounds in the atmosphere that are removed and broken down by sink processes, such
as methane, carbon is instead redistributed among the different reservoirs of the global carbon cycle and ultimately
recycled back to the atmosphere on a multitude of time scales. FAQ 6.2, Figure 1 shows a simplified diagram of the
global carbon cycle. The open arrows indicate typical timeframes for carbon atoms to be transferred through the
different reservoirs.
Before the Industrial Era, the global carbon cycle was
roughly balanced. This can be inferred from ice core
measurements, which show a near constant atmospheric concentration of CO2 over the last several
thousand years prior to the Industrial Era. Anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, however, have disturbed that equilibrium. As
global CO2 concentrations rise, the exchange processes between CO2 and the surface ocean and vegetation
are altered, as are subsequent exchanges within and
among the carbon reservoirs on land, in the ocean
and eventually, the Earth crust. In this way, the added
carbon is redistributed by the global carbon cycle,
until the exchanges of carbon between the different
carbon reservoirs have reached a new, approximate
balance.
Over the ocean, CO2 molecules pass through the
air-sea interface by gas exchange. In seawater, CO2
interacts with water molecules to form carbonic acid,
which reacts very quickly with the large reservoir of
dissolved inorganic carbon—bicarbonate and carbonate ions—in the ocean. Currents and the formation of
sinking dense waters transport the carbon between the surface and deeper layers of the ocean. The marine biota
also redistribute carbon: marine organisms grow organic tissue and calcareous shells in surface waters, which, after
their death, sink to deeper waters, where they are returned to the dissolved inorganic carbon reservoir by dissolution and microbial decomposition. A small fraction reaches the sea floor, and is incorporated into the sediments.
The extra carbon from anthropogenic emissions has the effect of increasing the atmospheric partial pressure of CO2,
which in turn increases the air-to-sea exchange of CO2 molecules. In the surface ocean, the carbonate chemistry
quickly accommodates that extra CO2. As a result, shallow surface ocean waters reach balance with the atmosphere
within 1 or 2 years. Movement of the carbon from the surface into the middle depths and deeper waters takes
longer—between decades and many centuries. On still longer time scales, acidification by the invading CO2 dissolves carbonate sediments on the sea floor, which further enhances ocean uptake. However, current understanding suggests that, unless substantial ocean circulation changes occur, plankton growth remains roughly unchanged
because it is limited mostly by environmental factors, such as nutrients and light, and not by the availability of
inorganic carbon it does not contribute significantly to the ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2. On land, vegetation absorbs CO2 by photosynthesis and converts it into organic matter. A fraction of this carbon is
immediately returned to the atmosphere as CO2 by plant respiration. Plants use the remainder for growth. Dead
plant material is incorporated into soils, eventually to be decomposed by microorganisms and then respired back
into the atmosphere as CO2. In addition, carbon in vegetation and soils is also converted back into CO2 by fires,
insects, herbivores, as well as by harvest of plants and subsequent consumption by livestock or humans. Some
organic carbon is furthermore carried into the ocean by streams and rivers.
An increase in atmospheric CO2 stimulates photosynthesis, and thus carbon uptake. In addition, elevated CO2 concentrations help plants in dry areas to use ground water more efficiently. This in turn increases the biomass in vegetation and soils and so fosters a carbon sink on land. The magnitude of this sink, however, also depends critically
on other factors, such as water and nutrient availability.
Coupled carbon-cycle climate models indicate that less carbon is taken up by the ocean and land as the climate
warms constituting a positive climate feedback. Many different factors contribute to this effect: warmer seawater,
for instance, has a lower CO2 solubility, so altered chemical carbon reactions result in less oceanic uptake of excess
atmospheric CO2. On land, higher temperatures foster longer seasonal growth periods in temperate and higher
latitudes, but also faster respiration of soil carbon.
The time it takes to reach a new carbon distribution balance depends on the transfer times of carbon through the
different reservoirs, and takes place over a multitude of time scales. Carbon is first exchanged among the ‘fast’
carbon reservoirs, such as the atmosphere, surface ocean, land vegetation and soils, over time scales up to a few
thousand years. Over longer time scales, very slow secondary geological processes—dissolution of carbonate sediments and sediment burial into the Earth’s crust—become important.
FAQ 6.2, Figure 2 illustrates the decay of a large excess amount of CO2 (5000 PgC, or about 10 times the cumulative
CO2 emitted so far since the beginning of the industrial Era) emitted into the atmosphere, and how it is redistributed among land and the ocean over time. During the first 200 years, the ocean and land take up similar amounts
of carbon. On longer time scales, the ocean uptake dominates mainly because of its larger reservoir size (~38,000
PgC) as compared to land (~4000 PgC) and atmosphere (589 PgC prior to the Industrial Era). Because of ocean
chemistry the size of the initial input is important: higher emissions imply that a larger fraction of CO2 will remain
in the atmosphere. After 2000 years, the atmosphere will still contain between 15% and 40% of those initial CO2
emissions. A further reduction by carbonate sediment dissolution, and reactions with igneous rocks, such as silicate
weathering and sediment burial, will take anything from tens to hundreds of thousands of years, or even longer.",a
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,How Do Clouds Affect Climate and Climate Change?,q
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"Clouds strongly affect the current climate, but observations alone cannot yet tell us how they will affect a future,
warmer climate. Comprehensive prediction of changes in cloudiness requires a global climate model. Such models
simulate cloud fields that roughly resemble those observed, but important errors and uncertainties remain. Different climate models produce different projections of how clouds will change in a warmer climate. Based on all
available evidence, it seems likely that the net cloud–climate feedback amplifies global warming. If so, the strength
of this amplification remains uncertain.
Since the 1970s, scientists have recognized the critical importance of clouds for the climate system, and for climate
change. Clouds affect the climate system in a variety of ways. They produce precipitation (rain and snow) that is
necessary for most life on land. They warm the atmosphere as water vapour condenses. Although some of the condensed water re-evaporates, the precipitation that reaches the surface represents a net warming of the air. Clouds
strongly affect the flows of both sunlight (warming the planet) and infrared light (cooling the planet as it is radiated to space) through the atmosphere. Finally, clouds contain powerful updraughts that can rapidly carry air from
near the surface to great heights. The updraughts carry energy, moisture, momentum, trace gases, and aerosol
particles. For decades, climate scientists have been using both observations and models to study how clouds change
with the daily weather, with the seasonal cycle, and with year-to-year changes such as those associated with El Niño.
All cloud processes have the potential to change as the climate state changes. Cloud feedbacks are of intense interest in the context of climate change. Any change in a cloud process that is caused by climate change—and in turn
influences climate—represents a cloud–climate feedback. Because clouds interact so strongly with both sunlight
and infrared light, small changes in cloudiness can have a potent effect on the climate system.
Many possible types of cloud–climate feedbacks have been suggested, involving changes in cloud amount, cloudtop height and/or cloud reflectivity (see FAQ7.1, Figure 1). The literature shows consistently that high clouds amplify
global warming as they interact with infrared light emitted by the atmosphere and surface. There is more uncertainty, however, about the feedbacks associated with low-altitude clouds, and about cloud feedbacks associated
with amount and reflectivity in general.
Thick high clouds efficiently reflect sunlight, and both thick and thin high clouds strongly reduce the amount of
infrared light that the atmosphere and surface emit to space. The compensation between these two effects makes the surface temperature somewhat less sensitive to changes in high cloud amount than to changes in low cloud
amount. This compensation could be disturbed if there were a systematic shift from thick high cloud to thin cirrus
cloud or vice versa; while this possibility cannot be ruled out, it is not currently supported by any evidence. On
the other hand, changes in the altitude of high clouds (for a given high-cloud amount) can strongly affect surface
temperature. An upward shift in high clouds reduces the infrared light that the surface and atmosphere emit to
space, but has little effect on the reflected sunlight. There is strong evidence of such a shift in a warmer climate.
This amplifies global warming by preventing some of the additional infrared light emitted by the atmosphere and
surface from leaving the climate system.
Low clouds reflect a lot of sunlight back to space but, for a given state of the atmosphere and surface, they have
only a weak effect on the infrared light that is emitted to space by the Earth. As a result, they have a net cooling
effect on the present climate; to a lesser extent, the same holds for mid-level clouds. In a future climate warmed
by increasing greenhouse gases, most IPCC-assessed climate models simulate a decrease in low and mid-level cloud
amount, which would increase the absorption of sunlight and so tend to increase the warming. The extent of this
decrease is quite model-dependent, however.
There are also other ways that clouds may change in a warmer climate. Changes in wind patterns and storm tracks
could affect the regional and seasonal patterns of cloudiness and precipitation. Some studies suggest that the signal
of one such trend seen in climate models—a poleward migration of the clouds associated with mid-latitude storm
tracks—is already detectable in the observational record. By shifting clouds into regions receiving less sunlight, this
could also amplify global warming. More clouds may be made of liquid drops, which are small but numerous and
reflect more sunlight back to space than a cloud composed of the same mass of larger ice crystals. Thin cirrus cloud,
which exerts a net warming effect and is very hard for climate models to simulate, could change in ways not simulated by models although there is no evidence for this. Other processes may be regionally important, for example,
interactions between clouds and the surface can change over the ocean where sea ice melts, and over land where
plant transpiration is reduced.
There is as yet no broadly accepted way to infer global cloud feedbacks from observations of long-term cloud trends
or shorter-time scale variability. Nevertheless, all the models used for the current assessment (and the preceding
two IPCC assessments) produce net cloud feedbacks that either enhance anthropogenic greenhouse warming or
have little overall effect. Feedbacks are not ‘put into’ the models, but emerge from the functioning of the clouds in
the simulated atmosphere and their effects on the flows and transformations of energy in the climate system. The
differences in the strengths of the cloud feedbacks produced by the various models largely account for the different
sensitivities of the models to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations.",a
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,How Do Aerosols Affect Climate and Climate Change?,q
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"Atmospheric aerosols are composed of small liquid or solid particles suspended in the atmosphere, other than larger
cloud and precipitation particles. They come from natural and anthropogenic sources, and can affect the climate in
multiple and complex ways through their interactions with radiation and clouds. Overall, models and observations
indicate that anthropogenic aerosols have exerted a cooling influence on the Earth since pre-industrial times, which
has masked some of the global mean warming from greenhouse gases that would have occurred in their absence.
The projected decrease in emissions of anthropogenic aerosols in the future, in response to air quality policies,
would eventually unmask this warming.
Atmospheric aerosols have a typical lifetime of one day to two weeks in the troposphere, and about one year in the
stratosphere. They vary greatly in size, chemical composition and shape. Some aerosols, such as dust and sea spray,
are mostly or entirely of natural origin, while other aerosols, such as sulphates and smoke, come from both natural
and anthropogenic sources.
Aerosols affect climate in many ways. First, they scatter and absorb sunlight, which modifies the Earth’s radiative
balance (see FAQ.7.2, Figure 1). Aerosol scattering generally makes the planet more reflective, and tends to cool
the climate, while aerosol absorption has the opposite effect, and tends to warm the climate system. The balance
between cooling and warming depends on aerosol properties and environmental conditions. Many observational
studies have quantified local radiative effects from anthropogenic and natural aerosols, but determining their global impact requires satellite data and models.
One of the remaining uncertainties comes from
black carbon, an absorbing aerosol that not
only is more difficult to measure than scattering
aerosols, but also induces a complicated cloud
response. Most studies agree, however, that
the overall radiative effect from anthropogenic
aerosols is to cool the planet.
Aerosols also serve as condensation and ice
nucleation sites, on which cloud droplets and ice
particles can form (see FAQ.7.2, Figure 2). When
influenced by more aerosol particles, clouds of
liquid water droplets tend to have more, but
smaller droplets, which causes these clouds to
reflect more solar radiation. There are however
many other pathways for aerosol–cloud interactions, particularly in ice—or mixed liquid and
ice—clouds, where phase changes between
liquid and ice water are sensitive to aerosol concentrations and properties. The initial view that
an increase in aerosol concentration will also
increase the amount of low clouds has been
challenged because a number of counteracting
processes come into play. Quantifying the overall
impact of aerosols on cloud amounts and properties is understandably difficult. Available studies,
based on climate models and satellite observations, generally indicate that the net effect of
anthropogenic aerosols on clouds is to cool the
climate system.
Because aerosols are distributed unevenly in the
atmosphere, they can heat and cool the climate
system in patterns that can drive changes in the
weather. These effects are complex, and hard to
simulate with current models, but several studies suggest significant effects on precipitation in
certain regions.
Because of their short lifetime, the abundance of
aerosols—and their climate effects—have varied
over time, in rough concert with anthropogenic
emissions of aerosols and their precursors in the gas phase such as sulphur dioxide (SO2) and some volatile organic
compounds. Because anthropogenic aerosol emissions have increased substantially over the industrial period, this
has counteracted some of the warming that would otherwise have occurred from increased concentrations of well
mixed greenhouse gases. Aerosols from large volcanic eruptions that enter the stratosphere, such as those of El
Chichón and Pinatubo, have also caused cooling periods that typically last a year or two.
Over the last two decades, anthropogenic aerosol emissions have decreased in some developed countries, but
increased in many developing countries. The impact of aerosols on the global mean surface temperature over this
particular period is therefore thought to be small. It is projected, however, that emissions of anthropogenic aerosols will ultimately decrease in response to air quality policies, which would suppress their cooling influence on the
Earth’s surface, thus leading to increased warming.",a
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"Could Geoengineering Counteract Climate Change and What Side Effects
Might Occur?",q
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"Geoengineering—also called climate engineering—is defined as a broad set of methods and technologies that aim
to deliberately alter the climate system in order to alleviate impacts of climate change. Two distinct categories of
geoengineering methods are usually considered: Solar Radiation Management (SRM, assessed in Section 7.7) aims
to offset the warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gases by making the planet more reflective while Carbon
Dioxide Removal (CDR, assessed in Section 6.5) aims at reducing the atmospheric CO2 concentration. The two categories operate on different physical principles and on different time scales. Models suggest that if SRM methods
were realizable they would be effective in countering increasing temperatures, and would be less, but still, effective
in countering some other climate changes. SRM would not counter all effects of climate change, and all proposed
geoengineering methods also carry risks and side effects. Additional consequences cannot yet be anticipated as the
level of scientific understanding about both SRM and CDR is low. There are also many (political, ethical, and practical) issues involving geoengineering that are beyond the scope of this report.
Carbon Dioxide Removal Methods
CDR methods aim at removing CO2 from the atmosphere by deliberately modifying carbon cycle processes, or by
industrial (e.g., chemical) approaches. The carbon withdrawn from the atmosphere would then be stored in land,
ocean or in geological reservoirs. Some CDR methods rely on biological processes, such as large-scale afforestation/
reforestation, carbon sequestration in soils through biochar, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)
and ocean fertilization. Others would rely on geological processes, such as accelerated weathering of silicate and
carbonate rocks—on land or in the ocean (see FAQ.7.3, Figure 1). The CO2 removed from the atmosphere would then be stored in organic form in land reservoirs, or in inorganic form in oceanic and geological reservoirs, where
it would have to be stored for at least hundreds of years for CDR to be effective.
CDR methods would reduce the radiative forcing of CO2 inasmuch as they are effective at removing CO2 from the
atmosphere and keeping the removed carbon away from the atmosphere. Some methods would also reduce ocean
acidification (see FAQ 3.2), but other methods involving oceanic storage might instead increase ocean acidification
if the carbon is sequestered as dissolved CO2. A major uncertainty related to the effectiveness of CDR methods
is the storage capacity and the permanence of stored carbon. Permanent carbon removal and storage by CDR
would decrease climate warming in the long term. However, non-permanent storage strategies would allow CO2 to
return back to the atmosphere where it would once again contribute to warming. An intentional removal of CO2
by CDR methods will be partially offset by the response of the oceanic and terrestrial carbon reservoirs if the CO2
atmospheric concentration is reduced. This is because some oceanic and terrestrial carbon reservoirs will outgas to
the atmosphere the anthropogenic CO2 that had previously been stored. To completely offset past anthropogenic
CO2 emissions, CDR techniques would therefore need to remove not just the CO2 that has accumulated in the
atmosphere since pre-industrial times, but also the anthropogenic carbon previously taken up by the terrestrial
biosphere and the ocean.
Biological and most chemical weathering CDR methods cannot be scaled up indefinitely and are necessarily limited
by various physical or environmental constraints such as competing demands for land. Assuming a maximum CDR
sequestration rate of 200 PgC per century from a combination of CDR methods, it would take about one and half
centuries to remove the CO2 emitted in the last 50 years, making it difficult—even for a suite of additive CDR methods—to mitigate climate change rapidly. Direct air capture methods could in principle operate much more rapidly,
but may be limited by large-scale implementation, including energy use and environmental constraints.
CDR could also have climatic and environmental side effects. For instance, enhanced vegetation productivity may
increase emissions of N2O, which is a more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. A large-scale increase in vegetation
coverage, for instance through afforestation or energy crops, could alter surface characteristics, such as surface
reflectivity and turbulent fluxes. Some modelling studies have shown that afforestation in seasonally snow-covered
boreal regions could in fact accelerate global warming, whereas afforestation in the tropics may be more effective
at slowing global warming. Ocean-based CDR methods that rely on biological production (i.e., ocean fertilization)
would have numerous side effects on ocean ecosystems, ocean acidity and may produce emissions of non-CO2
greenhouse gases.
Solar Radiation Management Methods
The globally averaged surface temperature of the planet is strongly influenced by the amount of sunlight absorbed
by the Earth’s atmosphere and surface, which warms the planet, and by the existence of the greenhouse effect,
the process by which greenhouse gases and clouds affect the way energy is eventually radiated back to space. An
increase in the greenhouse effect leads to a surface temperature rise until a new equilibrium is found. If less incoming sunlight is absorbed because the planet has been made more reflective, or if energy can be emitted to space
more effectively because the greenhouse effect is reduced, the average global surface temperature will be reduced.
Suggested geoengineering methods that aim at managing the Earth’s incoming and outgoing energy flows are
based on this fundamental physical principle. Most of these methods propose to either reduce sunlight reaching
the Earth or increase the reflectivity of the planet by making the atmosphere, clouds or the surface brighter (see
FAQ 7.3, Figure 1). Another technique proposes to suppress high-level clouds called cirrus, as these clouds have a
strong greenhouse effect. Basic physics tells us that if any of these methods change energy flows as expected, then
the planet will cool. The picture is complicated, however, because of the many and complex physical processes
which govern the interactions between the flow of energy, the atmospheric circulation, weather and the resulting
climate.
While the globally averaged surface temperature of the planet will respond to a change in the amount of sunlight
reaching the surface or a change in the greenhouse effect, the temperature at any given location and time is influenced by many other factors and the amount of cooling from SRM will not in general equal the amount of warming caused by greenhouse gases. For example, SRM will change heating rates only during daytime, but increasing
greenhouse gases can change temperatures during both day and night. This inexact compensation can influence the diurnal cycle of surface temperature, even if the average surface temperature is unchanged. As another example, model calculations suggest that a uniform decrease in sunlight reaching the surface might offset global mean
CO2-induced warming, but some regions will cool less than others. Models suggest that if anthropogenic greenhouse warming were completely compensated by stratospheric aerosols, then polar regions would be left with a
small residual warming, while tropical regions would become a little cooler than in pre-industrial times.
SRM could theoretically counteract anthropogenic climate change rapidly, cooling the Earth to pre-industrial levels
within one or two decades. This is known from climate models but also from the climate records of large volcanic
eruptions. The well-observed eruption of Mt Pinatubo in 1991 caused a temporary increase in stratospheric aerosols
and a rapid decrease in surface temperature of about 0.5°C.
Climate consists of many factors besides surface temperature. Consequences for other climate features, such as
rainfall, soil moisture, river flow, snowpack and sea ice, and ecosystems may also be important. Both models and
theory show that compensating an increased greenhouse effect with SRM to stabilize surface temperature would
somewhat lower the globally averaged rainfall (see FAQ 7.3, Figure 2 for an idealized model result), and there
also could be regional changes. Such imprecise compensation in
regional and global climate patterns makes it improbable that SRM
will produce a future climate that is ‘just like’ the one we experience today, or have experienced in the past. However, available
climate models indicate that a geoengineered climate with SRM
and high atmospheric CO2 levels would be generally closer to 20th
century climate than a future climate with elevated CO2 concentrations and no SRM.
SRM techniques would probably have other side effects. For example, theory, observation and models suggest that stratospheric
sulphate aerosols from volcanic eruptions and natural emissions
deplete stratospheric ozone, especially while chlorine from chlorofluorocarbon emissions resides in the atmosphere. Stratospheric
aerosols introduced for SRM are expected to have the same effect.
Ozone depletion would increase the amount of ultraviolet light
reaching the surface damaging terrestrial and marine ecosystems.
Stratospheric aerosols would also increase the ratio of direct to diffuse sunlight reaching the surface, which generally increases plant
productivity. There has also been some concern that sulphate aerosol SRM would increase acid rain, but model studies suggest that
acid rain is probably not a major concern since the rate of acid rain
production from stratospheric aerosol SRM would be much smaller
than values currently produced by pollution sources. SRM will also
not address the ocean acidification associated with increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and its impacts on marine ecosystems.
Without conventional mitigation efforts or potential CDR methods, high CO2 concentrations from anthropogenic emissions will
persist in the atmosphere for as long as a thousand years, and SRM
would have to be maintained as long as CO2 concentrations were
high. Stopping SRM while CO2 concentrations are still high would
lead to a very rapid warming over one or two decades (see FAQ7.3,
Figure 2), severely stressing ecosystem and human adaptation.
If SRM were used to avoid some consequences of increasing CO2 concentrations, the risks, side effects and shortcomings would clearly increase as the scale of SRM increase. Approaches have been proposed to use a time-limited
amount of SRM along with aggressive strategies for reducing CO2 concentrations to help avoid transitions across
climate thresholds or tipping points that would be unavoidable otherwise; assessment of such approaches would
require a very careful risk benefit analysis that goes much beyond this Report.",a
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,How Important Is Water Vapour to Climate Change?,q
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"As the largest contributor to the natural greenhouse effect, water vapour plays an essential role in the Earth’s
climate. However, the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere is controlled mostly by air temperature, rather
than by emissions. For that reason, scientists consider it a feedback agent, rather than a forcing to climate change.
Anthropogenic emissions of water vapour through irrigation or power plant cooling have a negligible impact on
the global climate.
Water vapour is the primary greenhouse gas in the Earth’s atmosphere. The contribution of water vapour to the
natural greenhouse effect relative to that of carbon dioxide (CO2) depends on the accounting method, but can
be considered to be approximately two to three times greater. Additional water vapour is injected into the atmosphere from anthropogenic activities, mostly through increased evaporation from irrigated crops, but also through
power plant cooling, and marginally through the combustion of fossil fuel. One may therefore question why there
is so much focus on CO2, and not on water vapour, as a forcing to climate change.
Water vapour behaves differently from CO2 in one fundamental way: it can condense and precipitate. When air
with high humidity cools, some of the vapour condenses into water droplets or ice particles and precipitates. The
typical residence time of water vapour in the atmosphere is ten days. The flux of water vapour into the atmosphere
from anthropogenic sources is considerably less than from ‘natural’ evaporation. Therefore, it has a negligible
impact on overall concentrations, and does not contribute significantly to the long-term greenhouse effect. This is
the main reason why tropospheric water vapour (typically below 10 km altitude) is not considered to be an anthropogenic gas contributing to radiative forcing.
Anthropogenic emissions do have a significant impact on water vapour in the stratosphere, which is the part of
the atmosphere above about 10 km. Increased concentrations of methane (CH4) due to human activities lead to
an additional source of water, through oxidation, which partly explains the observed changes in that atmospheric
layer. That stratospheric water change has a radiative impact, is considered a forcing, and can be evaluated. Stratospheric concentrations of water have varied significantly in past decades. The full extent of these variations is not
well understood and is probably less a forcing than
a feedback process added to natural variability. The
contribution of stratospheric water vapour to warming, both forcing and feedback, is much smaller than
from CH4 or CO2.
The maximum amount of water vapour in the air
is controlled by temperature. A typical column of
air extending from the surface to the stratosphere
in polar regions may contain only a few kilograms
of water vapour per square metre, while a similar column of air in the tropics may contain up to
70 kg. With every extra degree of air temperature,
the atmosphere can retain around 7% more water
vapour (see upper-left insert in the FAQ 8.1, Figure
1). This increase in concentration amplifies the greenhouse effect, and therefore leads to more warming.
This process, referred to as the water vapour feedback, is well understood and quantified. It occurs in
all models used to estimate climate change, where
its strength is consistent with observations. Although
an increase in atmospheric water vapour has been
observed, this change is recognized as a climate feedback (from increased atmospheric temperature) and
should not be interpreted as a radiative forcing from
anthropogenic emissions. Currently, water vapour has the largest greenhouse effect in the Earth’s atmosphere. However, other greenhouse
gases, primarily CO2, are necessary to sustain the presence of water vapour in the atmosphere. Indeed, if these other
gases were removed from the atmosphere, its temperature would drop sufficiently to induce a decrease of water
vapour, leading to a runaway drop of the greenhouse effect that would plunge the Earth into a frozen state. So
greenhouse gases other than water vapour provide the temperature structure that sustains current levels of atmospheric water vapour. Therefore, although CO2 is the main anthropogenic control knob on climate, water vapour
is a strong and fast feedback that amplifies any initial forcing by a typical factor between two and three. Water
vapour is not a significant initial forcing, but is nevertheless a fundamental agent of climate change.",a
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,Do Improvements in Air Quality Have an Effect on Climate Change?,q
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"Yes they do, but depending on which pollutant(s) they limit, they can either cool or warm the climate. For example,
whereas a reduction in sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions leads to more warming, nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission
control has both a cooling (through reducing of tropospheric ozone) and a warming effect (due to its impact on
methane lifetime and aerosol production). Air pollution can also affect precipitation patterns.
Air quality is nominally a measure of airborne surface pollutants, such as ozone, carbon monoxide, NOx and aerosols
(solid or liquid particulate matter). Exposure to such pollutants exacerbates respiratory and cardiovascular diseases,
harms plants and damages buildings. For these reasons, most major urban centres try to control discharges of airborne pollutants.
Unlike carbon dioxide (CO2) and other well-mixed greenhouse gases, tropospheric ozone and aerosols may last in
the atmosphere only for a few days to a few weeks, though indirect couplings within the Earth system can prolong
their impact. These pollutants are usually most potent near their area of emission or formation, where they can
force local or regional perturbations to climate, even if their globally averaged effect is small.
Air pollutants affect climate differently according to their physical and chemical characteristics. Pollution-generated
greenhouse gases will impact climate primarily through shortwave and longwave radiation, while aerosols can in
addition affect climate through cloud–aerosol interactions.
Controls on anthropogenic emissions of methane (FAQ 8.2, Figure 1) to lower surface ozone have been identified as
‘win–win’ situations. Consequences of controlling other ozone precursors are not always as clear. NOx emission controls, for instance, might be expected to have a cooling effect as they reduce tropospheric ozone, but their impact
on CH4 lifetime and aerosol formation is more likely instead to cause overall warming.
Satellite observations have identified increasing atmospheric concentrations of SO2 (the primary precursor to scattering sulphate aerosols) from coal-burning power plants over eastern Asia during the last few decades. The most
recent power plants use scrubbers to reduce such emissions (albeit not the concurrent CO2 emissions and associated
long-term climate warming). This improves air quality, but also reduces the cooling effect of sulphate aerosols and
therefore exacerbates warming. Aerosol cooling occurs through aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions
and is estimated at –0.9 W m–2 (all aerosols combined, Section 8.3.4.3) since pre-industrial, having grown especially
during the second half of the 20th century when anthropogenic emissions rose sharply. Black carbon or soot, on the other hand, absorbs heat in the atmosphere (leading to a 0.4 W m–2 radiative forcing
from anthropogenic fossil and biofuel emissions) and, when deposited on snow, reduces its albedo, or ability to
reflect sunlight. Reductions of black carbon emissions can therefore have a cooling effect, but the additional interaction of black carbon with clouds is uncertain and could lead to some counteracting warming.
Air quality controls might also target a specific anthropogenic activity sector, such as transportation or energy production. In that case, co-emitted species within the targeted sector lead to a complex mix of chemistry and climate
perturbations. For example, smoke from biofuel combustion contains a mixture of both absorbing and scattering
particles as well as ozone precursors, for which the combined climate impact can be difficult to ascertain.
Thus, surface air quality controls will have some consequences on climate. Some couplings between the targeted
emissions and climate are still poorly understood or identified, including the effects of air pollutants on precipitation patterns, making it difficult to fully quantify these consequences. There is an important twist, too, in the
potential effect of climate change on air quality. In particular, an observed correlation between surface ozone
and temperature in polluted regions indicates that higher temperatures from climate change alone could worsen
summertime pollution, suggesting a ‘climate penalty’. This penalty implies stricter surface ozone controls will be
required to achieve a specific target. In addition, projected changes in the frequency and duration of stagnation
events could impact air quality conditions. These features will be regionally variable and difficult to assess, but
better understanding, quantification and modelling of these processes will clarify the overall interaction between
air pollutants and climate.",a
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"Are Climate Models Getting Better, and How Would We Know?",q
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"Climate models are extremely sophisticated computer programs that encapsulate our understanding of the climate
system and simulate, with as much fidelity as currently feasible, the complex interactions between the atmosphere,
ocean, land surface, snow and ice, the global ecosystem and a variety of chemical and biological processes.
The complexity of climate models—the representation of physical processes like clouds, land surface interactions
and the representation of the global carbon and sulphur cycles in many models—has increased substantially since
the IPCC First Assessment Report in 1990, so in that sense, current Earth System Models are vastly ‘better’ than the
models of that era. This development has continued since the Fourth Assessment, while other factors have also
contributed to model improvement. More powerful supercomputers allow current models to resolve finer spatial
detail. Today’s models also reflect improved understanding of how climate processes work—understanding that has
come from ongoing research and analysis, along with new and improved observations.
Climate models of today are, in principle, better than their predecessors. However, every bit of added complexity,
while intended to improve some aspect of simulated climate, also introduces new sources of possible error (e.g., via
uncertain parameters) and new interactions between model components that may, if only temporarily, degrade a
model’s simulation of other aspects of the climate system. Furthermore, despite the progress that has been made,
scientific uncertainty regarding the details of many processes remains.
An important consideration is that model performance
can be evaluated only relative to past observations,
taking into account natural internal variability. To have
confidence in the future projections of such models, historical climate—and its variability and change—must be
well simulated. The scope of model evaluation, in terms
of the kind and quantity of observations available, the
availability of better coordinated model experiments,
and the expanded use of various performance metrics, has provided much more quantitative information
about model performance. But this alone may not be
sufficient. Whereas weather and seasonal climate predictions can be regularly verified, climate projections
spanning a century or more cannot. This is particularly
the case as anthropogenic forcing is driving the climate
system toward conditions not previously observed in the
instrumental record, and it will always be a limitation.
Quantifying model performance is a topic that has featured in all previous IPCC Working Group I Reports.
Reading back over these earlier assessments provides
a general sense of the improvements that have been
made. Past reports have typically provided a rather
broad survey of model performance, showing differences between model-calculated versions of various climate
quantities and corresponding observational estimates.
Inevitably, some models perform better than others for
certain climate variables, but no individual model clearly emerges as ‘the best’ overall. Recently, there has been
progress in computing various performance metrics,
which synthesize model performance relative to a range
of different observations according to a simple numerical score. Of course, the definition of such a score, how
it is computed, the observations used (which have their own uncertainties), and the manner in which various scores are combined are all important, and will affect the end
result.
Nevertheless, if the metric is computed consistently, one can compare different generations of models. Results
of such comparisons generally show that, although each generation exhibits a range in performance, the average model performance index has improved steadily between each generation. An example of changes in model
performance over time is shown in FAQ 9.1, Figure 1, and illustrates the ongoing, albeit modest, improvement. It
is interesting to note that both the poorest and best performing models demonstrate improvement, and that this
improvement comes in parallel with increasing model complexity and an elimination of artificial adjustments to
atmosphere and ocean coupling (so-called ‘flux adjustment’). Some of the reasons for this improvement include
increased understanding of various climate processes and better representation of these processes in climate
models. More comprehensive Earth observations are also driving improvements.
So, yes, climate models are getting better, and we can demonstrate this with quantitative performance metrics
based on historical observations. Although future climate projections cannot be directly evaluated, climate models
are based, to a large extent, on verifiable physical principles and are able to reproduce many important aspects of
past response to external forcing. In this way, they provide a scientifically sound preview of the climate response to
different scenarios of anthropogenic forcing.",a
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"Climate Is Always Changing. How Do We Determine the Causes of Observed
Changes?",q
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"The causes of observed long-term changes in climate (on time scales longer than a decade) are assessed by determining whether the expected ‘fingerprints’ of different causes of climate change are present in the historical record.
These fingerprints are derived from computer model simulations of the different patterns of climate change caused
by individual climate forcings. On multi-decade time scales, these forcings include processes such as greenhouse gas
increases or changes in solar brightness. By comparing the simulated fingerprint patterns with observed climate
changes, we can determine whether observed changes are best explained by those fingerprint patterns, or by natural variability, which occurs without any forcing.
The fingerprint of human-caused greenhouse gas increases is clearly apparent in the pattern of observed 20th century climate change. The observed change cannot be otherwise explained by the fingerprints of natural forcings
or natural variability simulated by climate models. Attribution studies therefore support the conclusion that ‘it is
extremely likely that human activities have caused more than half of the observed increase in global mean surface
temperatures from 1951 to 2010.’
The Earth’s climate is always changing, and that can occur for many reasons. To determine the principal causes of
observed changes, we must first ascertain whether an observed change in climate is different from other fluctuations that occur without any forcing at all. Climate variability without forcing—called internal variability—is the
consequence of processes within the climate system. Large-scale oceanic variability, such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) fluctuations in the Pacific Ocean, is the dominant source of internal climate variability on decadal to
centennial time scales.
Climate change can also result from natural forcings external to the climate system, such as volcanic eruptions, or
changes in the brightness of the sun. Forcings such as these are responsible for the huge changes in climate that are
clearly documented in the geological record. Human-caused forcings include greenhouse gas emissions or atmospheric particulate pollution. Any of these forcings, natural or human caused, could affect internal variability as well
as causing a change in average climate. Attribution studies attempt to determine the causes of a detected change in
observed climate. Over the past century we know that global average temperature has increased, so if the observed
change is forced then the principal forcing must be one that causes warming, not cooling.
Formal climate change attribution studies are carried out using controlled experiments with climate models. The
model-simulated responses to specific climate forcings are often called the fingerprints of those forcings. A climate
model must reliably simulate the fingerprint patterns associated with individual forcings, as well as the patterns of
unforced internal variability, in order to yield a meaningful climate change attribution assessment. No model can
perfectly reproduce all features of climate, but many detailed studies indicate that simulations using current models
are indeed sufficiently reliable to carry out attribution assessments.
FAQ 10.1, Figure 1 illustrates part of a fingerprint assessment of global temperature change at the surface during
the late 20th century. The observed change in the latter half of the 20th century, shown by the black time series
in the left panels, is larger than expected from just internal variability. Simulations driven only by natural forcings
(yellow and blue lines in the upper left panel) fail to reproduce late 20th century global warming at the surface with
a spatial pattern of change (upper right) completely different from the observed pattern of change (middle right).
Simulations including both natural and human-caused forcings provide a much better representation of the time
rate of change (lower left) and spatial pattern (lower right) of observed surface temperature change.
Both panels on the left show that computer models reproduce the naturally forced surface cooling observed for a
year or two after major volcanic eruptions, such as occurred in 1982 and 1991. Natural forcing simulations capture
the short-lived temperature changes following eruptions, but only the natural + human caused forcing simulations
simulate the longer-lived warming trend.
A more complete attribution assessment would examine temperature above the surface, and possibly other climate
variables, in addition to the surface temperature results shown in FAQ 10.1, Figure 1. The fingerprint patterns associated with individual forcings become easier to distinguish when more variables are considered in the assessment. Overall, FAQ 10.1, Figure 1 shows that the pattern of observed temperature change is significantly different than
the pattern of response to natural forcings alone. The simulated response to all forcings, including human-caused
forcings, provides a good match to the observed changes at the surface. We cannot correctly simulate recent
observed climate change without including the response to human-caused forcings, including greenhouse gases,
stratospheric ozone, and aerosols. Natural causes of change are still at work in the climate system, but recent trends
in temperature are largely attributable to human-caused forcing. ",a
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,When Will Human Influences on Climate Become Obvious on Local Scales?,q
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"Human-caused warming is already becoming locally obvious on land in some tropical regions, especially during the
warm part of the year. Warming should become obvious in middle latitudes—during summer at first—within the
next several decades. The trend is expected to emerge more slowly there, especially during winter, because natural
climate variability increases with distance from the equator and during the cold season. Temperature trends already
detected in many regions have been attributed to human influence. Temperature-sensitive climate variables, such
as Arctic sea ice, also show detected trends attributable to human influence.
Warming trends associated with global change are generally more evident in averages of global temperature than
in time series of local temperature (‘local’ here refers generally to individual locations, or small regional averages).
This is because most of the local variability of local climate is averaged away in the global mean. Multi-decadal
warming trends detected in many regions are considered to be outside the range of trends one might expect from
natural internal variability of the climate system, but such trends will only become obvious when the local mean climate emerges from the ‘noise’ of year-to-year variability. How quickly this happens depends on both the rate of the
warming trend and the amount of local variability. Future warming trends cannot be predicted precisely, especially
at local scales, so estimates of the future time of emergence of a warming trend cannot be made with precision.
In some tropical regions, the warming trend has already emerged from local variability (FAQ 10.2, Figure 1). This
happens more quickly in the tropics because there is less temperature variability there than in other parts of the
globe. Projected warming may not emerge in middle latitudes until the mid-21st century—even though warming
trends there are larger—because local temperature variability is substantially greater there than in the tropics. On a
seasonal basis, local temperature variability tends to be smaller in summer than in winter. Warming therefore tends
to emerge first in the warm part of the year, even in regions where the warming trend is larger in winter, such as in
central Eurasia in FAQ 10.2, Figure 1.
Variables other than land surface temperature, including some oceanic regions, also show rates of long-term change
different from natural variability. For example, Arctic sea ice extent is declining very rapidly, and already shows a
human influence. On the other hand, local precipitation trends are very hard to detect because at most locations
the variability in precipitation is quite large. The probability of record-setting warm summer temperatures has
increased throughout much of the Northern Hemisphere . High temperatures presently considered extreme are
projected to become closer to the norm over the coming decades. The probabilities of other extreme events, including some cold spells, have lessened.
In the present climate, individual extreme weather events cannot be unambiguously ascribed to climate change,
since such events could have happened in an unchanged climate. However the probability of occurrence of such
events could have changed significantly at a particular location. Human-induced increases in greenhouse gases are
estimated to have contributed substantially to the probability of some heatwaves. Similarly, climate model studies
suggest that increased greenhouse gases have contributed to the observed intensification of heavy precipitation
events found over parts of the Northern Hemisphere. However, the probability of many other extreme weather
events may not have changed substantially. Therefore, it is incorrect to ascribe every new weather record to climate
change.
The date of future emergence of projected warming trends also depends on local climate variability, which can
temporarily increase or decrease temperatures. Furthermore, the projected local temperature curves shown in FAQ
10.2, Figure 1 are based on multiple climate model simulations forced by the same assumed future emissions scenario. A different rate of atmospheric greenhouse gas accumulation would cause a different warming trend, so the
spread of model warming projections (the coloured shading in FAQ 10.2, Figure 1) would be wider if the figure
included a spread of greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. The increase required for summer temperature change to
emerge from 20th century local variability (regardless of the rate of change) is depicted on the central map in FAQ
10.2, Figure 1.
A full answer to the question of when human influence on local climate will become obvious depends on the
strength of evidence one considers sufficient to render something ‘obvious’. The most convincing scientific evidence
for the effect of climate change on local scales comes from analysing the global picture, and from the wealth of
evidence from across the climate system linking many observed changes to human influence. ",a
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"If You Cannot Predict the Weather Next Month, How Can You Predict Climate
for the Coming Decade?",q
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"Although weather and climate are intertwined, they are in fact different things. Weather is defined as the state of
the atmosphere at a given time and place, and can change from hour to hour and day to day. Climate, on the other
hand, generally refers to the statistics of weather conditions over a decade or more.
An ability to predict future climate without the need to accurately predict weather is more commonplace that it
might first seem. For example, at the end of spring, it can be accurately predicted that the average air temperature
over the coming summer in Melbourne (for example) will very likely be higher than the average temperature during
the most recent spring—even though the day-to-day weather during the coming summer cannot be predicted with
accuracy beyond a week or so. This simple example illustrates that factors exist—in this case the seasonal cycle in
solar radiation reaching the Southern Hemisphere—that can underpin skill in predicting changes in climate over a
coming period that does not depend on accuracy in predicting weather over the same period.
The statistics of weather conditions used to define climate include long-term averages of air temperature and
rainfall, as well as statistics of their variability, such as the standard deviation of year-to-year rainfall variability
from the long-term average, or the frequency of days below 5°C. Averages of climate variables over long periods
of time are called climatological averages. They can apply to individual months, seasons or the year as a whole. A
climate prediction will address questions like: ‘How likely will it be that the average temperature during the coming
summer will be higher than the long-term average of past summers?’ or: ‘How likely will it be that the next decade
will be warmer than past decades?’ More specifically, a climate prediction might provide an answer to the question:
‘What is the probability that temperature (in China, for instance) averaged over the next ten years will exceed the
temperature in China averaged over the past 30 years?’ Climate predictions do not provide forecasts of the detailed
day-to-day evolution of future weather. Instead, they provide probabilities of long-term changes to the statistics of
future climatic variables.
Weather forecasts, on the other hand, provide predictions of day-to-day weather for specific times in the future.
They help to address questions like: ‘Will it rain tomorrow?’ Sometimes, weather forecasts are given in terms of probabilities. For example, the weather forecast might state that: ‘the likelihood of rainfall in Apia tomorrow is 75%’.
To make accurate weather predictions, forecasters need highly detailed information about the current state of the
atmosphere. The chaotic nature of the atmosphere means that even the tiniest error in the depiction of ‘initial conditions’ typically leads to inaccurate forecasts beyond a week or so. This is the so-called ‘butterfly effect’.
Climate scientists do not attempt or claim to predict the detailed future evolution of the weather over coming
seasons, years or decades. There is, on the other hand, a sound scientific basis for supposing that aspects of climate
can be predicted, albeit imprecisely, despite the butterfly effect. For example, increases in long-lived atmospheric
greenhouse gas concentrations tend to increase surface temperature in future decades. Thus, information from the
past can and does help predict future climate.
Some types of naturally occurring so-called ‘internal’ variability can—in theory at least—extend the capacity to
predict future climate. Internal climatic variability arises from natural instabilities in the climate system. If such
variability includes or causes extensive, long-lived, upper ocean temperature anomalies, this will drive changes in
the overlying atmosphere, both locally and remotely. The El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon is probably
the most famous example of this kind of internal variability. Variability linked to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation
unfolds in a partially predictable fashion. The butterfly effect is present, but it takes longer to strongly influence
some of the variability linked to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation.
Meteorological services and other agencies have exploited this. They have developed seasonal-to-interannual prediction systems that enable them to routinely predict seasonal climate anomalies with demonstrable predictive skill.
The skill varies markedly from place to place and variable to variable. Skill tends to diminish the further the prediction delves into the future and in some locations there is no skill at all. ‘Skill’ is used here in its technical sense: it is a
measure of how much greater the accuracy of a prediction is, compared with the accuracy of some typically simple
prediction method like assuming that recent anomalies will persist during the period being predicted.
Weather, seasonal-to-interannual and decadal prediction systems are similar in many ways (e.g., they all incorporate the same mathematical equations for the atmosphere, they all need to specify initial conditions to kick-start predictions, and they are all subject to limits on forecast accuracy imposed by the butterfly effect). However, decadal
prediction, unlike weather and seasonal-to-interannual prediction, is still in its infancy. Decadal prediction systems
nevertheless exhibit a degree of skill in hindcasting near-surface temperature over much of the globe out to at least
nine years. A ‘hindcast’ is a prediction of a past event in which only observations prior to the event are fed into
the prediction system used to make the prediction. The bulk of this skill is thought to arise from external forcing.
‘External forcing’ is a term used by climate scientists to refer to a forcing agent outside the climate system causing
a change in the climate system. This includes increases in the concentration of long-lived greenhouse gases.
Theory indicates that skill in predicting decadal precipitation should be less than the skill in predicting decadal surface temperature, and hindcast performance is consistent with this expectation.
Current research is aimed at improving decadal prediction systems, and increasing the understanding of the reasons
for any apparent skill. Ascertaining the degree to which the extra information from internal variability actually
translates to increased skill is a key issue. While prediction systems are expected to improve over coming decades,
the chaotic nature of the climate system and the resulting butterfly effect will always impose unavoidable limits
on predictive skill. Other sources of uncertainty exist. For example, as volcanic eruptions can influence climate but
their timing and magnitude cannot be predicted, future eruptions provide one of a number of other sources of
uncertainty. Additionally, the shortness of the period with enough oceanic data to initialize and assess decadal
predictions presents a major challenge.
Finally, note that decadal prediction systems are designed to exploit both externally forced and internally generated sources of predictability. Climate scientists distinguish between decadal predictions and decadal projections. Projections exploit only the predictive capacity arising from external forcing. While previous IPCC Assessment Reports
focussed exclusively on projections, this report also assesses decadal prediction research and its scientific basis. ",a
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,How Do Volcanic Eruptions Affect Climate and Our Ability to Predict Climate?,q
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"Large volcanic eruptions affect the climate by injecting sulphur dioxide gas into the upper atmosphere (also called
stratosphere), which reacts with water to form clouds of sulphuric acid droplets. These clouds reflect sunlight back
to space, preventing its energy from reaching the Earth’s surface, thus cooling it, along with the lower atmosphere.
These upper atmospheric sulphuric acid clouds also locally absorb energy from the Sun, the Earth and the lower
atmosphere, which heats the upper atmosphere (see FAQ 11.2, Figure 1). In terms of surface cooling, the 1991
Mt Pinatubo eruption in the Philippines, for example, injected about 20 million tons of sulphur dioxide (SO2) into
the stratosphere, cooling the Earth by about 0.5°C for up to a year. Globally, eruptions also reduce precipitation,
because the reduced incoming shortwave at the surface is compensated by a reduction in latent heating (i.e., in
evaporation and hence rainfall).
For the purposes of predicting climate, an eruption causing significant global surface cooling and upper atmospheric heating for the next year or so can be expected. The problem is that, while a volcano that has become more
active can be detected, the precise timing of an eruption, or the amount of SO2 injected into the upper atmosphere
and how it might disperse cannot be predicted. This is a source of uncertainty in climate predictions.
Large volcanic eruptions produce lots of particles, called ash or tephra. However, these particles fall out of the
atmosphere quickly, within days or weeks, so they do not affect the global climate. For example, the 1980 Mount
St. Helens eruption affected surface temperatures in the northwest USA for several days but, because it emitted
little SO2 into the stratosphere, it had no detectable global climate impacts. If large, high-latitude eruptions inject
sulphur into the stratosphere, they will have an effect only in the hemisphere where they erupted, and the effects
will only last a year at most, as the stratospheric cloud they produce only has a lifetime of a few months.
Tropical or subtropical volcanoes produce more global surface or tropospheric cooling. This is because the resulting
sulphuric acid cloud in the upper atmosphere lasts between one and two years, and can cover much of the globe.
However, their regional climatic impacts are difficult to
predict, because dispersion of stratospheric sulphate
aerosols depends heavily on atmospheric wind conditions at the time of eruption. Furthermore, the surface
cooling effect is typically not uniform: because continents cool more than the ocean, the summer monsoon
can weaken, reducing rain over Asia and Africa. The climatic response is complicated further by the fact that
upper atmospheric clouds from tropical eruptions also
absorb sunlight and heat from the Earth, which produces more upper atmosphere warming in the tropics than
at high latitudes.
The largest volcanic eruptions of the past 250 years stimulated scientific study. After the 1783 Laki eruption in
Iceland, there were record warm summer temperatures
in Europe, followed by a very cold winter. Two large
eruptions, an unidentified one in 1809, and the 1815
Tambora eruption caused the ‘Year Without a Summer’
in 1816. Agricultural failures in Europe and the USA that
year led to food shortages, famine and riots.
The largest eruption in more than 50 years, that of
Agung in 1963, led to many modern studies, including
observations and climate model calculations. Two subsequent large eruptions, El Chichón in 1982 and Pinatubo
in 1991, inspired the work that led to our current understanding of the effects of volcanic eruptions on climate. Volcanic clouds remain in the stratosphere only for a couple of years, so their impact on climate is correspondingly
short. But the impacts of consecutive large eruptions can last longer: for example, at the end of the 13th century
there were four large eruptions—one every ten years. The first, in 1258 CE, was the largest in 1000 years. That
sequence of eruptions cooled the North Atlantic Ocean and Arctic sea ice. Another period of interest is the three
large, and several lesser, volcanic events during 1963–1991 (see Chapter 8 for how these eruptions affected atmospheric composition and reduced shortwave radiation at the ground.
Volcanologists can detect when a volcano becomes more active, but they cannot predict whether it will erupt,
or if it does, how much sulphur it might inject into the stratosphere. Nevertheless, volcanoes affect the ability to
predict climate in three distinct ways. First, if a violent eruption injects significant volumes of sulphur dioxide into
the stratosphere, this effect can be included in climate predictions. There are substantial challenges and sources of
uncertainty involved, such as collecting good observations of the volcanic cloud, and calculating how it will move
and change during its lifetime. But, based on observations, and successful modelling of recent eruptions, some of
the effects of large eruptions can be included in predictions.
The second effect is that volcanic eruptions are a potential source of uncertainty in our predictions. Eruptions
cannot be predicted in advance, but they will occur, causing short-term climatic impacts on both local and global
scales. In principle, this potential uncertainty can be accounted for by including random eruptions, or eruptions
based on some scenario in our near-term ensemble climate predictions. This area of research needs further exploration. The future projections in this report do not include future volcanic eruptions.
Third, the historical climate record can be used, along with estimates of observed sulphate aerosols, to test the
fidelity of our climate simulations. While the climatic response to explosive volcanic eruptions is a useful analogue
for some other climatic forcings, there are limitations. For example, successfully simulating the impact of one eruption can help validate models used for seasonal and interannual predictions. But in this way not all the mechanisms
involved in global warming over the next century can be validated, because these involve long term oceanic feedbacks, which have a longer time scale than the response to individual volcanic eruptions.",a
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,Why Are So Many Models and Scenarios Used to Project Climate Change?,q
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"Future climate is partly determined by the magnitude of future emissions of greenhouse gases, aerosols and other
natural and man-made forcings. These forcings are external to the climate system, but modify how it behaves.
Future climate is shaped by the Earth’s response to those forcings, along with internal variability inherent in the
climate system. A range of assumptions about the magnitude and pace of future emissions helps scientists develop
different emission scenarios, upon which climate model projections are based. Different climate models, meanwhile, provide alternative representations of the Earth’s response to those forcings, and of natural climate variability. Together, ensembles of models, simulating the response to a range of different scenarios, map out a range of
possible futures, and help us understand their uncertainties.
Predicting socioeconomic development is arguably even more difficult than predicting the evolution of a physical
system. It entails predicting human behaviour, policy choices, technological advances, international competition
and cooperation. The common approach is to use scenarios of plausible future socioeconomic development, from
which future emissions of greenhouse gases and other forcing agents are derived. It has not, in general, been possible to assign likelihoods to individual forcing scenarios. Rather, a set of alternatives is used to span a range of
possibilities. The outcomes from different forcing scenarios provide policymakers with alternatives and a range of
possible futures to consider.
Internal fluctuations in climate are spontaneously generated by interactions between components such as the
atmosphere and the ocean. In the case of near-term climate change, they may eclipse the effect of external perturbations, like greenhouse gas increases (see Chapter 11). Over the longer term, however, the effect of external
forcings is expected to dominate instead. Climate model simulations project that, after a few decades, different
scenarios of future anthropogenic greenhouse gases and other forcing agents—and the climate system’s response
to them—will differently affect the change in mean global temperature (FAQ 12.1, Figure 1, left panel). Therefore,
evaluating the consequences of those various scenarios and responses is of paramount importance, especially when
policy decisions are considered.
Climate models are built on the basis of the physical principles governing our climate system, and empirical understanding, and represent the complex, interacting processes needed to simulate climate and climate change, both
past and future. Analogues from past observations, or extrapolations from recent trends, are inadequate strategies
for producing projections, because the future will not necessarily be a simple continuation of what we have seen
thus far.
Although it is possible to write down the equations of fluid motion that determine the behaviour of the atmosphere and ocean, it is impossible to solve them without using numerical algorithms through computer model
simulation, similarly to how aircraft engineering relies on numerical simulations of similar types of equations. Also,
many small-scale physical, biological and chemical processes, such as cloud processes, cannot be described by those
equations, either because we lack the computational ability to describe the system at a fine enough resolution
to directly simulate these processes or because we still have a partial scientific understanding of the mechanisms
driving these processes. Those need instead to be approximated by so-called parameterizations within the climate
models, through which a mathematical relation between directly simulated and approximated quantities is established, often on the basis of observed behaviour.
There are various alternative and equally plausible numerical representations, solutions and approximations for
modelling the climate system, given the limitations in computing and observations. This diversity is considered a
healthy aspect of the climate modelling community, and results in a range of plausible climate change projections
at global and regional scales. This range provides a basis for quantifying uncertainty in the projections, but because
the number of models is relatively small, and the contribution of model output to public archives is voluntary,
the sampling of possible futures is neither systematic nor comprehensive. Also, some inadequacies persist that are
common to all models; different models have different strength and weaknesses; it is not yet clear which aspects
of the quality of the simulations that can be evaluated through observations should guide our evaluation of future
model simulations. Models of varying complexity are commonly used for different projection problems. A faster model with lower
resolution, or a simplified description of some climate processes, may be used in cases where long multi-century
simulations are required, or where multiple realizations are needed. Simplified models can adequately represent
large-scale average quantities, like global average temperature, but finer details, like regional precipitation, can be
simulated only by complex models.
The coordination of model experiments and output by groups such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
(CMIP), the World Climate Research Program and its Working Group on Climate Models has seen the science community step up efforts to evaluate the ability of models to simulate past and current climate and to compare future
climate change projections. The ‘multi-model’ approach is now a standard technique used by the climate science
community to assess projections of a specific climate variable.
FAQ 12.1, Figure 1, right panels, shows the temperature response by the end of the 21st century for two illustrative
models and the highest and lowest RCP scenarios. Models agree on large-scale patterns of warming at the surface,
for example, that the land is going to warm faster than ocean, and the Arctic will warm faster than the tropics. But
they differ both in the magnitude of their global response for the same scenario, and in small scale, regional aspects
of their response. The magnitude of Arctic amplification, for instance, varies among different models, and a subset
of models show a weaker warming or slight cooling in the North Atlantic as a result of the reduction in deepwater
formation and shifts in ocean currents.
There are inevitable uncertainties in future external forcings, and the climate system’s response to them, which
are further complicated by internally generated variability. The use of multiple scenarios and models have become
a standard choice in order to assess and characterize them, thus allowing us to describe a wide range of possible
future evolutions of the Earth’s climate.",a
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,How Will the Earth’s Water Cycle Change?,q
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"The flow and storage of water in the Earth’s climate system are highly variable, but changes beyond those due to
natural variability are expected by the end of the current century. In a warmer world, there will be net increases in
rainfall, surface evaporation and plant transpiration. However, there will be substantial differences in the changes
between locations. Some places will experience more precipitation and an accumulation of water on land. In others,
the amount of water will decrease, due to regional drying and loss of snow and ice cover.
The water cycle consists of water stored on the Earth in all its phases, along with the movement of water through
the Earth’s climate system. In the atmosphere, water occurs primarily as a gas—water vapour—but it also occurs as
ice and liquid water in clouds. The ocean, of course, is primarily liquid water, but the ocean is also partly covered by
ice in polar regions. Terrestrial water in liquid form appears as surface water—such as lakes and rivers—soil moisture
and groundwater. Solid terrestrial water occurs in ice sheets, glaciers, snow and ice on the surface and in permafrost
and seasonally frozen soil.
Statements about future climate sometimes say that the water cycle will accelerate, but this can be misleading, for
strictly speaking, it implies that the cycling of water will occur more and more quickly with time and at all locations.
Parts of the world will indeed experience intensification of the water cycle, with larger transports of water and
more rapid movement of water into and out of storage reservoirs. However, other parts of the climate system will
experience substantial depletion of water, and thus less movement of water. Some stores of water may even vanish.
As the Earth warms, some general features of change will occur simply in response to a warmer climate. Those
changes are governed by the amount of energy that global warming adds to the climate system. Ice in all forms will
melt more rapidly, and be less pervasive. For example, for some simulations assessed in this report, summer Arctic
sea ice disappears before the middle of this century. The atmosphere will have more water vapour, and observations
and model results indicate that it already does. By the end of the 21st century, the average amount of water vapour
in the atmosphere could increase by 5 to 25%, depending on the amount of human emissions of greenhouse gases
and radiatively active particles, such as smoke. Water will evaporate more quickly from the surface. Sea level will
rise due to expansion of warming ocean waters and melting land ice flowing into the ocean (see FAQ 13.2).
These general changes are modified by the complexity of the climate system, so that they should not be expected
to occur equally in all locations or at the same pace. For example, circulation of water in the atmosphere, on land
and in the ocean can change as climate changes, concentrating water in some locations and depleting it in others.
The changes also may vary throughout the year: some seasons tend to be wetter than others. Thus, model simulations assessed in this report show that winter precipitation in northern Asia may increase by more than 50%,
whereas summer precipitation there is projected to hardly change. Humans also intervene directly in the water
cycle, through water management and changes in land use. Changing population distributions and water practices
would produce further changes in the water cycle.
Water cycle processes can occur over minutes, hours, days and longer, and over distances from metres to kilometres
and greater. Variability on these scales is typically greater than for temperature, so climate changes in precipitation
are harder to discern. Despite this complexity, projections of future climate show changes that are common across
many models and climate forcing scenarios. Similar changes were reported in the AR4. These results collectively
suggest well understood mechanisms of change, even if magnitudes vary with model and forcing. We focus here
on changes over land, where changes in the water cycle have their largest impact on human and natural systems.
Projected climate changes from simulations assessed in this report (shown schematically in FAQ 12.2, Figure 1) generally show an increase in precipitation in parts of the deep tropics and polar latitudes that could exceed 50% by the
end of the 21st century under the most extreme emissions scenario. In contrast, large areas of the subtropics could
have decreases of 30% or more. In the tropics, these changes appear to be governed by increases in atmospheric
water vapour and changes in atmospheric circulation that further concentrate water vapour in the tropics and thus
promote more tropical rainfall. In the subtropics, these circulation changes simultaneously promote less rainfall
despite warming in these regions. Because the subtropics are home to most of the world’s deserts, these changes
imply increasing aridity in already dry areas, and possible expansion of deserts. Increases at higher latitudes are governed by warmer temperatures, which allow more water in the atmosphere and
thus, more water that can precipitate. The warmer climate also allows storm systems in the extratropics to transport
more water vapour into the higher latitudes, without requiring substantial changes in typical wind strength. As
indicated above, high latitude changes are more pronounced during the colder seasons.
Whether land becomes drier or wetter depends partly on precipitation changes, but also on changes in surface
evaporation and transpiration from plants (together called evapotranspiration). Because a warmer atmosphere
can have more water vapour, it can induce greater evapotranspiration, given sufficient terrestrial water. However,
increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reduces a plant’s tendency to transpire into the atmosphere, partly
counteracting the effect of warming.
In the tropics, increased evapotranspiration tends to counteract the effects of increased precipitation on soil moisture, whereas in the subtropics, already low amounts of soil moisture allow for little change in evapotranspiration.
At higher latitudes, the increased precipitation generally outweighs increased evapotranspiration in projected climates, yielding increased annual mean runoff, but mixed changes in soil moisture. As implied by circulation changes
in FAQ 12.2, Figure 1, boundaries of high or low moisture regions may also shift.
A further complicating factor is the character of rainfall. Model projections show rainfall becoming more intense,
in part because more moisture will be present in the atmosphere. Thus, for simulations assessed in this report, over
much of the land, 1-day precipitation events that currently occur on average every 20 years could occur every 10
years or even more frequently by the end of the 21st century. At the same time, projections also show that precipitation events overall will tend to occur less frequently.
These changes produce two seemingly contradictory
effects: more intense downpours, leading to more
floods, yet longer dry periods between rain events,
leading to more drought.
At high latitudes and at high elevation, further changes
occur due to the loss of frozen water. Some of these are
resolved by the present generation of global climate
models (GCMs), and some changes can only be inferred
because they involve features such as glaciers, which
typically are not resolved or included in the models. The
warmer climate means that snow tends to start accumulating later in the fall, and melt earlier in the spring.
Simulations assessed in this report show March to April
snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere is projected to
decrease by approximately 10 to 30% on average by
the end of this century, depending on the greenhouse
gas scenario. The earlier spring melt alters the timing
of peak springtime flow in rivers receiving snowmelt.
As a result, later flow rates will decrease, potentially
affecting water resource management. These features
appear in GCM simulations.
Loss of permafrost will allow moisture to seep more
deeply into the ground, but it will also allow the
ground to warm, which could enhance evapotranspiration. However, most current GCMs do not include all the processes needed to simulate well permafrost changes. Studies analysing soils freezing or using GCM output to drive
more detailed land models suggest substantial permafrost loss by the end of this century. In addition, even though
current GCMs do not explicitly include glacier evolution, we can expect that glaciers will continue to recede, and
the volume of water they provide to rivers in the summer may dwindle in some locations as they disappear. Loss of
glaciers will also contribute to a reduction in springtime river flow. However, if annual mean precipitation increases—either as snow or rain—then these results do not necessarily mean that annual mean river flow will decrease.",a
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,What Would Happen to Future Climate if We Stopped Emissions Today?,q
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"Stopping emissions today is a scenario that is not plausible, but it is one of several idealized cases that provide
insight into the response of the climate system and carbon cycle. As a result of the multiple time scales in the climate
system, the relation between change in emissions and climate response is quite complex, with some changes still
occurring long after emissions ceased. Models and process understanding show that as a result of the large ocean
inertia and the long lifetime of many greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, much of the warming would
persist for centuries after greenhouse gas emissions have stopped.
When emitted in the atmosphere, greenhouse gases get removed through chemical reactions with other reactive
components or, in the case of carbon dioxide (CO2), get exchanged with the ocean and the land. These processes
characterize the lifetime of the gas in the atmosphere, defined as the time it takes for a concentration pulse to
decrease by a factor of e (2.71). How long greenhouse gases and aerosols persist in the atmosphere varies over a
wide range, from days to thousands of years. For example, aerosols have a lifetime of weeks, methane (CH4) of
about 10 years, nitrous oxide (N2O) of about 100 years and hexafluoroethane (C2F6) of about 10,000 years. CO2 is
more complicated as it is removed from the atmosphere through multiple physical and biogeochemical processes in
the ocean and the land; all operating at different time scales. For an emission pulse of about 1000 PgC, about half
is removed within a few decades, but the remaining fraction stays in the atmosphere for much longer. About 15 to
40% of the CO2 pulse is still in the atmosphere after 1000 years.
As a result of the significant lifetimes of major anthropogenic greenhouse gases, the increased atmospheric concentration due to past emissions will persist long after emissions are ceased. Concentration of greenhouse gases would
not return immediately to their pre-industrial levels if emissions were halted. Methane concentration would return
to values close to pre-industrial level in about 50 years, N2O concentrations would need several centuries, while
CO2 would essentially never come back to its pre-industrial level on time scales relevant for our society. Changes
in emissions of short-lived species like aerosols on the other hand would result in nearly instantaneous changes in
their concentrations.
The climate system response to the greenhouse gases
and aerosols forcing is characterized by an inertia,
driven mainly by the ocean. The ocean has a very large
capacity of absorbing heat and a slow mixing between
the surface and the deep ocean. This means that it will
take several centuries for the whole ocean to warm up
and to reach equilibrium with the altered radiative forcing. The surface ocean (and hence the continents) will
continue to warm until it reaches a surface temperature
in equilibrium with this new radiative forcing. The AR4
showed that if concentration of greenhouse gases were
held constant at present day level, the Earth surface
would still continue to warm by about 0.6°C over the
21st century relative to the year 2000. This is the climate
commitment to current concentrations (or constant
composition commitment), shown in grey in FAQ 12.3,
Figure 1. Constant emissions at current levels would further increase the atmospheric concentration and result
in much more warming than observed so far (FAQ 12.3,
Figure 1, red lines).
Even if anthropogenic greenhouses gas emissions were
halted now, the radiative forcing due to these longlived greenhouse gases concentrations would only
slowly decrease in the future, at a rate determined
by the lifetime of the gas (see above). Moreover, the climate response of the Earth System to that radiative forcing would be even slower. Global temperature would
not respond quickly to the greenhouse gas concentration changes. Eliminating CO2 emissions only would lead to
near constant temperature for many centuries. Eliminating short-lived negative forcings from sulphate aerosols at
the same time (e.g., by air pollution reduction measures) would cause a temporary warming of a few tenths of a
degree, as shown in blue in FAQ 12.3, Figure 1. Setting all emissions to zero would therefore, after a short warming,
lead to a near stabilization of the climate for multiple centuries. This is called the commitment from past emissions
(or zero future emission commitment). The concentration of GHG would decrease and hence the radiative forcing
as well, but the inertia of the climate system would delay the temperature response.
As a consequence of the large inertia in the climate and carbon cycle, the long-term global temperature is largely
controlled by total CO2 emissions that have accumulated over time, irrespective of the time when they were emitted. Limiting global warming below a given level (e.g., 2°C above pre-industrial) therefore implies a given budget
of CO2, that is, higher emissions earlier implies stronger reductions later. A higher climate target allows for a higher
CO2 concentration peak, and hence larger cumulative CO2 emissions (e.g., permitting a delay in the necessary emission reduction).
Global temperature is a useful aggregate number to describe the magnitude of climate change, but not all changes
will scale linearly global temperature. Changes in the water cycle for example also depend on the type of forcing
(e.g., greenhouse gases, aerosols, land use change), slower components of the Earth system such as sea level rise
and ice sheet would take much longer to respond, and there may be critical thresholds or abrupt or irreversible
changes in the climate system. ",a
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,Why Does Local Sea Level Change Differ from the Global Average?,q
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"Shifting surface winds, the expansion of warming ocean water, and the addition of melting ice can alter ocean currents which, in turn, lead to changes in sea level that vary from place to place. Past and present variations in the
distribution of land ice affect the shape and gravitational field of the Earth, which also cause regional fluctuations
in sea level. Additional variations in sea level are caused by the influence of more localized processes such as sediment compaction and tectonics.
Along any coast, vertical motion of either the sea or land surface can cause changes in sea level relative to the land
(known as relative sea level). For example, a local change can be caused by an increase in sea surface height, or by a
decrease in land height. Over relatively short time spans (hours to years), the influence of tides, storms and climatic
variability—such as El Niño—dominates sea level variations. Earthquakes and landslides can also have an effect by
causing changes in land height and, sometimes, tsunamis. Over longer time spans (decades to centuries), the influence of climate change—with consequent changes in volume of ocean water and land ice—is the main contributor
to sea level change in most regions. Over these longer time scales, various processes may also cause vertical motion
of the land surface, which can also result in substantial changes in relative sea level.
Since the late 20th century, satellite measurements of the height of the ocean surface relative to the center of the
Earth (known as geocentric sea level) show differing rates of geocentric sea level change around the world (see
FAQ 13.1, Figure 1). For example, in the western Pacific Ocean, rates were about three times greater than the global
mean value of about 3 mm per year from 1993 to 2012. In contrast, those in the eastern Pacific Ocean are lower
than the global mean value, with much of the west coast of the Americas experiencing a fall in sea surface height
over the same period. Much of the spatial variation shown in FAQ 13.1, Figure 1 is a result of natural climate variability—such as El Niño and
the Pacific Decadal Oscillation—over time scales from about a year to several decades. These climate variations alter
surface winds, ocean currents, temperature and salinity, and hence affect sea level. The influence of these processes
will continue during the 21st century, and will be superimposed on the spatial pattern of sea level change associated
with longer term climate change, which also arises through changes in surface winds, ocean currents, temperature
and salinity, as well as ocean volume. However, in contrast to the natural variability, the longer term trends accumulate over time and so are expected to dominate over the 21st century. The resulting rates of geocentric sea level
change over this longer period may therefore exhibit a very different pattern from that shown in FAQ 13.1, Figure 1.
Tide gauges measure relative sea level, and so they include changes resulting from vertical motion of both the land
and the sea surface. Over many coastal regions, vertical land motion is small, and so the long-term rate of sea level
change recorded by coastal and island tide gauges is similar to the global mean value (see records at San Francisco
and Pago Pago in FAQ 13.1, Figure 1). In some regions, vertical land motion has had an important influence. For
example, the steady fall in sea level recorded at Stockholm (FAQ 13.1, Figure 1) is caused by uplift of this region
after the melting of a large (>1 km thick) continental ice sheet at the end of the last Ice Age, between ~20,000 and
~9000 years ago. Such ongoing land deformation as a response to the melting of ancient ice sheets is a significant
contributor to regional sea level changes in North America and northwest Eurasia, which were covered by large
continental ice sheets during the peak of the last Ice Age.
In other regions, this process can also lead to land subsidence, which elevates relative sea levels, as it has at Charlottetown, where a relatively large increase has been observed, compared to the global mean rate (FAQ 13.1, Figure
1). Vertical land motion due to movement of the Earth’s tectonic plates can also cause departures from the global
mean sea level trend in some areas—most significantly, those located near active subduction zones, where one tectonic plate slips beneath another. For the case of Antofagasta (FAQ 13.1, Figure 1) this appears to result in steady
land uplift and therefore relative sea level fall.
In addition to regional influences of vertical land motion
on relative sea level change, some processes lead to land
motion that is rapid but highly localized. For example,
the greater rate of rise relative to the global mean at
Manila (FAQ 13.1, Figure 1) is dominated by land subsidence caused by intensive groundwater pumping. Land
subsidence due to natural and anthropogenic processes,
such as the extraction of groundwater or hydrocarbons,
is common in many coastal regions, particularly in large
river deltas.
It is commonly assumed that melting ice from glaciers
or the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets would cause
globally uniform sea level rise, much like filling a bath
tub with water. In fact, such melting results in regional variations in sea level due to a variety of processes,
including changes in ocean currents, winds, the Earth’s
gravity field and land height. For example, computer
models that simulate these latter two processes predict a regional fall in relative sea level around the melting ice
sheets, because the gravitational attraction between ice and ocean water is reduced, and the land tends to rise
as the ice melts (FAQ 13.1, Figure 2). However, further away from the ice sheet melting, sea level rise is enhanced,
compared to the global average value.
In summary, a variety of processes drive height changes of the ocean surface and ocean floor, resulting in distinct
spatial patterns of sea level change at local to regional scales. The combination of these processes produces a
complex pattern of total sea level change, which varies through time as the relative contribution of each process
changes. The global average change is a useful single value that reflects the contribution of climatic processes (e.g.,
land-ice melting and ocean warming), and represents a good estimate of sea level change at many coastal locations. At the same time, however, where the various regional processes result in a strong signal, there can be large
departures from the global average value.",a
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,Will the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets Contribute to Sea Level Change over the Rest of the Century?,q
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"The Greenland, West and East Antarctic ice sheets are the largest reservoirs of freshwater on the planet. As such,
they have contributed to sea level change over geological and recent times. They gain mass through accumulation
(snowfall) and lose it by surface ablation (mostly ice melt) and outflow at their marine boundaries, either to a floating ice shelf, or directly to the ocean through iceberg calving. Increases in accumulation cause global mean sea level
to fall, while increases in surface ablation and outflow cause it to rise. Fluctuations in these mass fluxes depend
on a range of processes, both within the ice sheet and without, in the atmosphere and oceans. Over the course of
this century, however, sources of mass loss appear set to exceed sources of mass gain, so that a continuing positive
contribution to global sea level can be expected. This FAQ summarizes current research on the topic and provides
indicative magnitudes for the various end-of-century (2081-2100 with respect to 1986-2005) sea level contributions
from the full assessment, which are reported as the two-in-three probability level across all emission scenarios.
Over millennia, the slow horizontal flow of an ice sheet carries mass from areas of net accumulation (generally, in
the high-elevation interior) to areas of net loss (generally, the low-elevation periphery and the coastal perimeter).
At present, Greenland loses roughly half of its accumulated ice by surface ablation, and half by calving. Antarctica,
on the other hand, loses virtually all its accumulation by calving and submarine melt from its fringing ice shelves. Ice
shelves are floating, so their loss has only a negligible direct effect on sea level, although they can affect sea level
indirectly by altering the mass budget of their parent ice sheet (see below).
In East Antarctica, some studies using satellite radar altimetry suggest that snowfall has increased, but recent
atmospheric modelling and satellite measurements of changes in gravity find no significant increase. This apparent
disagreement may be because relatively small long-term trends are masked by the strong interannual variability
of snowfall. Projections suggest a substantial increase in 21st century Antarctic snowfall, mainly because a warmer
atmosphere would be able to carry more moisture into polar regions. Regional changes in atmospheric circulation
probably play a secondary role. For the whole of the Antarctic ice sheet, this process is projected to contribute
between 0 and 70 mm to sea level fall.
Currently, air temperatures around Antarctica are too cold for substantial surface ablation. Field and satellite-based
observations, however, indicate enhanced outflow—manifested as ice-surface lowering—in a few localized coastal
regions. These areas (Pine Island and Thwaites Glaciers in West Antarctica, and Totten and Cook Glaciers in East
Antarctica) all lie within kilometre-deep bedrock troughs towards the edge of Antarctica’s continental shelf. The
increase in outflow is thought to have been triggered by regional changes in ocean circulation, bringing warmer
water in contact with floating ice shelves.
On the more northerly Antarctic Peninsula, there is a well-documented record of ice-shelf collapse, which appears
to be related to the increased surface melting caused by atmospheric warming over recent decades. The subsequent
thinning of glaciers draining into these ice shelves has had a positive—but minor—effect on sea level, as will any
further such events on the Peninsula. Regional projections of 21st century atmospheric temperature change suggest
that this process will probably not affect the stability of the large ice shelves of both the West and East Antarctica,
although these ice shelves may be threatened by future oceanic change (see below).
Estimates of the contribution of the Antarctic ice sheets to sea level over the last few decades vary widely, but
great strides have recently been made in reconciling the observations. There are strong indications that enhanced
outflow (primarily in West Antarctica) currently outweighs any increase in snow accumulation (mainly in East Antarctica), implying a tendency towards sea level rise. Before reliable projections of outflow over the 21st century can
be made with greater confidence, models that simulate ice flow need to be improved, especially of any changes in
the grounding line that separates floating ice from that resting on bedrock and of interactions between ice shelves
and the ocean. The concept of ‘marine ice-sheet instability’ is based on the idea that the outflow from an ice sheet
resting on bedrock below sea level increases if ice at the grounding line is thicker and, therefore, faster flowing.
On bedrock that slopes downward towards the ice-sheet interior, this creates a vicious cycle of increased outflow,
causing ice at the grounding line to thin and go afloat. The grounding line then retreats down slope into thicker
ice that, in turn, drives further increases in outflow. This feedback could potentially result in the rapid loss of parts
of the ice sheet, as grounding lines retreat along troughs and basins that deepen towards the ice sheet’s interior Future climate forcing could trigger such an unstable collapse, which may then continue independently of climate.
This potential collapse might unfold over centuries for individual bedrock troughs in West Antarctica and sectors of
East Antarctica. Much research is focussed on understanding how important this theoretical concept is for those ice
sheets. Sea level could rise if the effects of marine instability become important, but there is not enough evidence
at present to unambiguously identify the precursor of such an unstable retreat. Change in outflow is projected
to contribute between –20 (i.e., fall) and 185 mm to sea level rise by year 2100, although the uncertain impact of
marine ice-sheet instability could increase this figure by several tenths of a metre. Overall, increased snowfall seems
set to only partially offset sea level rise caused by increased outflow.
In Greenland, mass loss through more surface ablation and outflow dominates a possible recent trend towards
increased accumulation in the interior. Estimated mass loss due to surface ablation has doubled since the early
1990s. This trend is expected to continue over the next century as more of the ice sheet experiences surface ablation for longer periods. Indeed, projections for the 21st century suggest that increasing mass loss will dominate
over weakly increasing accumulation. The refreezing of melt water within the snow pack high up on the ice sheet
offers an important (though perhaps temporary) dampening effect on the relation between atmospheric warming
and mass loss.
Although the observed response of outlet glaciers is both complex and highly variable, iceberg calving from many
of Greenland’s major outlet glaciers has increased substantially over the last decade, and constitutes an appreciable
additional mass loss. This seems to be related to the intrusion of warm water into the coastal seas around Greenland, but it is not clear whether this phenomenon is related to inter-decadal variability, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation, or a longer term trend associated with greenhouse gas–induced warming. Projecting its effect on 21st
century outflow is therefore difficult, but it does highlight the apparent sensitivity of outflow to ocean warming.
The effects of more surface melt water on the lubrication of the ice sheet’s bed, and the ability of warmer ice to
deform more easily, may lead to greater rates of flow, but the link to recent increases in outflow is unclear. Change
in the net difference between surface ablation and accumulation is projected to contribute between 10 and 160
mm to sea level rise in 2081-2100 (relative to 1986-2005), while increased outflow is projected to contribute a further 10 to 70 mm (Table 13.5).
The Greenland ice sheet has contributed to a rise in global mean sea level over the last few decades, and this trend
is expected to increase during this century. Unlike Antarctica, Greenland has no known large-scale instabilities
that might generate an abrupt increase in sea level rise over the 21st century. A threshold may exist, however, so
that continued shrinkage might become irreversible over multi-centennial time scales, even if the climate were to
return to a pre-industrial state over centennial time scales. Although mass loss through the calving of icebergs may
increase in future decades, this process will eventually end when the ice margin retreats onto bedrock above sea
level where the bulk of the ice sheet resides.",a
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,How is Climate Change Affecting Monsoons?,q
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"Monsoons are the most important mode of seasonal climate variation in the tropics, and are responsible for a large
fraction of the annual rainfall in many regions. Their strength and timing is related to atmospheric moisture content, land–sea temperature contrast, land cover and use, atmospheric aerosol loadings and other factors. Overall,
monsoonal rainfall is projected to become more intense in future, and to affect larger areas, because atmospheric
moisture content increases with temperature. However, the localized effects of climate change on regional monsoon strength and variability are complex and more uncertain.
Monsoon rains fall over all tropical continents: Asia, Australia, the Americas and Africa. The monsoon circulation is
driven by the difference in temperature between land and sea, which varies seasonally with the distribution of solar
heating. The duration and amount of rainfall depends on the moisture content of the air, and on the configuration
and strength of the atmospheric circulation. The regional distribution of land and ocean also plays a role, as does
topography. For example, the Tibetan Plateau—through variations in its snow cover and surface heating—modulates the strength of the complex Asian monsoon systems. Where moist on-shore winds rise over mountains, as they
do in southwest India, monsoon rainfall is intensified. On the lee side of such mountains, it lessens.
Since the late 1970s, the East Asian summer monsoon has been weakening and not extending as far north as it used
to in earlier times , as a result of changes in the atmospheric circulation. That in turn has led to increasing drought
in northern China, but floods in the Yangtze River Valley farther south. In contrast, the Indo-Australian and Western Pacific monsoon systems show no coherent trends since the mid-20th century, but are strongly modulated by
the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Similarly, changes observed in the South American monsoon system over
the last few decades are strongly related to ENSO variability. Evidence of trends in the North American monsoon
system is limited, but a tendency towards heavier rainfalls on the northern side of the main monsoon region has
been observed. No systematic long-term trends have been observed in the behaviour of the Indian or the African
monsoons.
The land surface warms more rapidly than the ocean surface, so that surface temperature contrast is increasing in
most regions. The tropical atmospheric overturning circulation, however, slows down on average as the climate
warms due to energy balance constraints in the tropical atmosphere. These changes in the atmospheric circulation
lead to regional changes in monsoon intensity, area and timing. There are a number of other effects as to how climate change can influence monsoons. Surface heating varies with the intensity of solar radiation absorption,
which is itself affected by any land use changes that alter the reflectivity (albedo) of the land surface. Also, changing atmospheric aerosol loadings, such as air pollution, affect how much solar radiation reaches the ground, which
can change the monsoon circulation by altering summer solar heating of the land surface. Absorption of solar
radiation by aerosols, on the other hand, warms the atmosphere, changing the atmospheric heating distribution.
The strongest effect of climate change on the monsoons is the increase in atmospheric moisture associated with
warming of the atmosphere, resulting in an increase in total monsoon rainfall even if the strength of the monsoon
circulation weakens or does not change.
Climate model projections through the 21st century show an increase in total monsoon rainfall, largely due to
increasing atmospheric moisture content. The total surface area affected by the monsoons is projected to increase,
along with the general poleward expansion of the tropical regions. Climate models project from 5% to an approximately 15% increase of global monsoon rainfall depending on scenarios. Though total tropical monsoon rainfall
increases, some areas will receive less monsoon rainfall, due to weakening tropical wind circulations. Monsoon
onset dates are likely to be early or not to change much and the monsoon retreat dates are likely to delay, resulting
in lengthening of the monsoon season.
Future regional trends in monsoon intensity and timing remain uncertain in many parts of the world. Year-to-year
variations in the monsoons in many tropical regions are affected by ENSO. How ENSO will change in future—and
how its effects on monsoon will change—also remain uncertain. However, the projected overall increase in monsoon rainfall indicates a corresponding increase in the risk of extreme rain events in most regions.",a
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"How Are Future Projections in Regional Climate Related to Projections of
Global Means?",q
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/05/WGI_AR5_FAQ_EN.pdf,"The relationship between regional climate change and global mean change is complex. Regional climates vary strongly with location and so respond differently to changes in global-scale influences. The global mean change is, in effect, a convenient summary of many diverse regional climate responses. Heat and moisture, and changes in them, are not evenly distributed across the globe for several reasons: • External forcings vary spatially (e.g., solar radiation depends on latitude, aerosol emissions have local sources, land use changes regionally, etc.). • Surface conditions vary spatially, for example, land/sea contrast, topography, sea surface temperatures, soil moisture content. • Weather systems and ocean currents redistribute heat and moisture from one region to another. Weather systems are associated with regionally important climate phenomena such as monsoons, tropical convergence zones, storm tracks and important modes of climate variability (e.g., El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Southern Annular Mode (SAM), etc.). In addition to modulating regional warming, some climate phenomena are also projected to change in the future, which can lead to further impacts on regional climates (see Table 14.3). Projections of change in surface temperature and precipitation show large regional variations (FAQ 14.2, Figure 1). Enhanced surface warming is projected to occur over the high-latitude continental regions and the Arctic ocean, while over other oceans and lower latitudes changes are closer to the global mean (FAQ 14.2, Figure 1a). For
example, warming near the Great Lakes area of North America is projected to be about 50% greater than that
of the global mean warming. Similar large regional variations are also seen in the projected changes of more
extreme temperatures (FAQ 14.2, Figure 1b). Projected changes in precipitation are even more regionally variable
than changes in temperature (FAQ 14.2, Figure 1c, d), caused by modulation from climate phenomena such as the
monsoons and tropical convergence zones. Near-equatorial latitudes are projected to have increased mean precipitation, while regions on the poleward edges of the subtropics are projected to have reduced mean precipitation.
Higher latitude regions are projected to have increased mean precipitation and in particular more extreme precipitation from extratropical cyclones.
Polar regions illustrate the complexity of processes involved in regional climate change. Arctic warming is projected
to increase more than the global mean, mostly because the melting of ice and snow produces a regional feedback
by allowing more heat from the Sun to be absorbed. This gives rise to further warming, which encourages more
melting of ice and snow. However, the projected warming over the Antarctic continent and surrounding oceans is
less marked in part due to a stronger positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode. Westerly winds over the midlatitude southern oceans have increased over recent decades, driven by the combined effect of loss of stratospheric
ozone over Antarctica, and changes in the atmosphere’s temperature structure related to increased greenhouse
gas concentrations. This change in the Southern Annular Mode is well captured by climate models and has the
effect of reducing atmospheric heat transport to the Antarctic continent. Nevertheless, the Antarctic Peninsula is
still warming rapidly, because it extends far enough northwards to be influenced by the warm air masses of the
westerly wind belt. ",a

Humanity’s accelerated burning of fossil fuels and deforestation (forests are key parts of the planet’s natural carbon management systems) have led to rapid increases of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and global warming.

Scientists have known for centuries that gases in Earth’s atmosphere like carbon dioxide and methane act as a greenhouse, preventing a certain amount of heat radiation from escaping back to space. The more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the warmer it gets.

Over Earth’s history, carbon dioxide levels fluctuate due to volcanic activity or the carbon cycle (animals and bacteria breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide while plants do the opposite).

However, the rises in temperature and carbon dioxide levels we’ve seen in the past century are extreme and are accelerating. The rate of carbon emissions are the highest they’ve been in 66 million years and the amount of warming in the coming decades is expected to be 250 times greater than the average warming during the past century.

Rising temperatures from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions affects planet-wide systems in various ways. For example, it warms the polar regions and the oceans, which melts ice cover at the poles and causes sea level rise. Climate change affects ocean habitats by lowering oxygen, decreasing phytoplankton (little plants that serve as the base of marine food chains) and killing coral reefs.

The warming of the atmosphere affects weather patterns, causing more frequent and severe storms and droughts across many global regions. Higher temperatures are affecting the length of seasons and in some places, are already crossing safe levels for ecosystems and humans .

Many species are approaching—or have already reached—the limit of where they can go to find hospitable climates. In the polar regions, animals like polar bears that live on polar ice are now struggling to survive as that ice melts.

It’s not just how climate change affects an animal directly; it’s about how the warming climate affects the ecosystem and food chain that animal has adapted to. In the U.S. and Canada, moose are struggling due to an increase in ticks and parasites that are surviving the shorter, milder winters.

In another case, salmon rely on steady-flowing cold rivers to spawn. As climate change alters the temperature and flow of these waterways, some salmon populations are dwindling. This affects many species that rely on salmon like orcas or grizzly bears.

In both oceans and on land, the changes in temperature and moisture are causing some species to migrate in search of new places to live. For instance, in North America, species are shifting their ranges an average of 11 miles north and 36 feet higher in elevation each decade to find more favorable conditions. The Central Appalachians are one resilient climate escape route that may help species adapt to changing conditions.

There are some natural places with enough diversity in altitude and geology such that as the planet warms, they can be resilient strongholds for plant and animal species. These strongholds serve as breeding grounds and seed banks for many plants and animals that otherwise may be unable to find habitat due to climate change. However, strongholds are not an option for all species, and some plants and animals are blocked from reaching strongholds by human development like cities, highways and farmland.

This negatively impacts lots of marine habitats and animals, but is a particular threat to shellfish who struggle to grow shells as water becomes more acidic.

There are deeper issues at play. As the ocean surface warms, it’s less able to mix with deep, nutrient-rich water which limits the growth of phytoplankton (little plants that serve as the base of the marine food web). This in turn affects the whole food chain.

There is also some evidence that warming surface waters may be contributing to slowing ocean currents. Together, these currents act like a giant global conveyor belt that transports heat from the tropics toward the poles.

However, farmers are poised to play a significant role in addressing climate change. Agricultural lands are among the Earth’s largest natural reservoirs of carbon, and when farmers use soil health practices like cover crops, reduced tillage and crop rotations, they can draw even more carbon out of the atmosphere.

These practices also help to improve the soil’s water-holding capacity, which is beneficial as water can be absorbed from the soil by crops during times of drought, and during heavy rainfalls, soil can help reduce flooding and run-off by slowing the release of water into streams.

To do that, we must as a planet commit ourselves to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

This is no small feat and will require a range of solutions applied together, to reach the goal. We'll need to transition all sectors of our economy away from fossil fuels that emit carbon, increase our use of clean energy sources like wind and solar, harness the power of nature to capture carbon, and deploy technologies that capture and store carbon. This transition will happen much faster and more cost-effectively if governments enact an economy-wide price on carbon.

Our research also shows that proper land management of forests and farmlands, also called natural climate solutions, can provide up to one-third of the emissions reductions necessary to reach the Paris Climate Agreement’s goal of aiming to keep temperature rise below 1.5 degrees (or nearly 3 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.

The truth, however, is that even if we do successfully reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we will still have to address harmful climate impacts, and so the solution to climate change must also include measures to adapt to the impacts of global warming.

https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,How do we know global temperatures are rising?,q
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,"We know that global temperatures are rising because several independent data sets, made up of direct measurements of the Earth’s surface temperature, reveal that globally averaged temperatures have warmed by about 1.0°C since 1850[1]. 

This warming has not happened in a smooth manner, as there are small variations year on year. The climate system is complex and greenhouse gases are not the only factor that contribute to temperature change. In addition to the impact of human activities on the climate, large amounts of energy move around naturally within the climate system, particularly between the atmosphere and ocean. This affects global temperatures over timescales of years by creating temporary warmer or cooler periods, such as during El Niño events.

However, the long-term temperature pattern since 1850 is clear. The historic trend of atmospheric warming observed for the last 150 years is remarkable and is substantially greater than can be explained by natural variations.

The cause of this temperature rise can be explained physically by the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations that have accompanied it. These have risen from 280 parts per million in around 1850, to over 400 parts per million today. This is a clear indication that human emissions of greenhouse gases are responsible for the rise in global temperatures. Natural climate processes could not have caused such a rapid and continued increase in surface temperature[2]. 

We can be confident in the data. The scientific processes of measuring historical and present-day temperature changes have become more refined and scientists regularly carry out careful quality checks to make sure their observations can be trusted and compared over time.

This includes making corrections to the time series of temperature records to account for variations in the location or environment of an observation station, or changes in the measurement techniques of historic temperature records. This monitoring makes us certain that increasing global temperatures are due to human activities since the industrial revolution, when the burning of fossil fuels started injecting huge levels of greenhouses gases into the atmosphere.",a
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,How have humans caused global temperatures to rise?,q
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,"Scientists use a mix of approaches to assess how human activities have caused climate change and the historical temperature increase of about 1.0°C since 1850. One of the techniques is the fundamental physical understanding of the greenhouse gas effect. 

Scientists started to understand the greenhouse gas effect from the 1820s, when they realised the presence of atmospheric gases warms the surface of the Earth. Greenhouse gases allow much of the Sun’s radiation to pass through the atmosphere to reach the Earth’s surface, but then stop heat radiation emitted by the warm surface from escaping back to space. Through this process, CO2 and other greenhouse gases raise the average temperature of the Earth’s surface from the -18°C it would be without an atmosphere to around +14°C[1]. 

CO2 is a potent greenhouse gas that, once injected into the atmosphere, remains and affects the climate system for centuries. Human activities have emitted increasing levels of CO2 since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. As the concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases, such as methane, increase in the atmosphere, they trap more heat and raise the surface temperature further. This causes global warming.  

To understand the effect of human activities in relation to natural variations in the climate system, scientists use complex computer simulations. These models calculate the temperature, wind, humidity and other meteorological parameters that are part of the natural climate system. Comparing the outputs of models that include only natural factors with models that take into account human activities shows clearly that humans have caused climate change. Models only show a temperature change consistent with the warming observed when they include emissions from human activities[2].   

This makes it clear that greenhouse gases, emitted through human activities such as industry, transport and agriculture, are the primary cause of global warming since 1850.",a
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,How do natural factors influence the climate? Can they explain climate change?,q
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,"The world’s climate is affected by many different natural processes that have a variety of impacts throughout time. These often influence global surface temperatures for a short while and make some  periods either warmer or colder. However, none of these natural factors can explain the long-term trend of global warming that we have observed since 1850 and are seeing today[1].

Volcanic eruptions are known to influence the climate system. They emit aerosols into the high atmosphere, which can block sunlight temporarily and so cool the surface temperature. The clearest example of this effect is the massive eruption of Mount Tambora in 1815, which led to the so-called ‘year without a summer’. However, the impact only lasted for a few years. This would be the case for any new volcanic eruptions as well. While volcanoes also release some CO2, the amount is negligible compared with CO2 emissions from human activities since industrialisation.

The oceans also distribute a huge amount of heat around the world. Every few years, off the west coast of South America, warm water from beneath the ocean surface rises to the top and pours heat into the atmosphere; this phenomenon is known as an El Niño event. This atmospheric heat affects the average temperature of the entire planet, which means the warmest years on record are often associated with the El Niño cycle. However, El Niño events do not explain the warming trend in global average temperature over the past century - they only temporarily elevate global temperatures by a small fraction of a degree.

The sun provides all the energy for the Earth’s climate. This means any changes in its radiative output also have a strong potential to influence global atmospheric and ocean temperatures.  Scientists have measured solar radiation using satellites over the past forty years, and have looked at indicators of solar activity over much longer periods in geological data. This evidence shows us that, over the past 10,000 years at least, the sun’s energy has varied by less than one tenth of one percent. This is enough to have caused variations in global temperature of around 0.1°C, but cannot explain the global warming of around 1°C over the past century[2].

These different natural factors play a role in cooling or heating the planet over relatively short periods of time, such as months and years. They cannot explain the warming trend of the past century. This can only be explained by the impact of human greenhouse gas emissions.",a
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,What determines how sensitive the planet’s surface temperature is to increasing greenhouse gases?,q
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,"‘Climate sensitivity’ is the way global temperatures respond to an increase in CO2 in the atmosphere. It helps us understand how much temperatures will rise in response to emissions from human activities. Scientists currently estimate that the climate warms by about between 1.5°C and 4.5°C each time the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere doubles[1].

Understanding this sensitivity takes into account other processes that can further amplify or diminish how the climate responds to warming following increases in CO2. For example, as the atmosphere warms, its water-vapour content increases. Because water vapour is also a greenhouse gas, it strongly enhances the temperature increase that would come from raised levels of CO2 alone. This is an example of how positive feedback processes amplify the climate’s response to warming from increased CO2 and make the impacts more severe. 

Clouds also play an important role in shaping how the Earth’s surface temperature responds to increases in atmospheric CO2. Thick, bright clouds lying over the ocean, particularly in the tropics, enhance the reflection of sunlight back to space, which acts to cool the planet. Thin, high, ice clouds, however, act like greenhouse gases and trap the heat. With increased warming, cloud reflection of sunlight is expected to decrease, while the cloud greenhouse effect will increase. These changes indicate that clouds play an important role in amplifying the effect of global warming, although their precise effects remain uncertain.

Another important process that influences climate sensitivity concerns ice caps, sea ice and glaciers. With their white, bright surfaces, snow-covered areas, they reflect sunlight away from Earth and cool it. However, as temperatures rise, snow and ice is melting in places like the Arctic. As snow cover decreases, it exposes water or land, which, because it is darker and so much less reflective, absorbs more sunlight. This is another positive feedback that amplifies global warming[2].",a
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,This is not the first time the climate has changed. How do we know we’re not just in a natural cycle between Ice Ages?,q
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,"Ice Ages happen when CO2 levels in the atmosphere are around 180 parts per million. The cyclical warmer periods in between Ice Ages – known as interglacial periods – happen at around 280 parts per million. This has been the case for all Ice Age cycles over the past 800,000 years; as far back as scientists have measurements from ice cores, in fact. Today, however, emissions from human activities have caused atmospheric CO2 levels to reach around 410 parts per million; far above the level for being a natural warm period within these 800,000 years, and it is still rising.

Ice Ages are triggered and paced by changes to incoming solar radiation, as variations in the Earth’s orbit change the way the Sun’s energy is distributed. In the Northern Hemisphere, the difference between summer and winter insolation – the amount of sunlight that reaches Earth – varies over cycles of 100,000, 40,000 and 21,000 years. When summer solar radiation is reduced, summer warming is unable to melt the snow that has built up over the previous winter. This kick-starts the process that leads to an Ice Age – which last happened on Earth about 20,000 years ago.

These natural variations in solar radiation are subtle, and scientists know they are too weak to build an Ice Age by themselves. However, their effect is amplified by feedback loops that make them stronger. For example, when the Earth’s surface turns white due to increased snow and ice cover, it becomes more reflective and so cools the planet further. Variation in CO2 levels is also an important feedback loop in creating an Ice Age. Part of this feedback loop relates to changes in how much CO2 the ocean stores.

As the polar oceans cool, they become more productive. This is because cooler surface water is less buoyant than warm water, and so encourages nutrient-rich subsurface water to ‘upwell’ into the surface layer of water – the ‘sunlit zone’. Nutrient-rich water absorbs more atmospheric CO2 into the shells and bones of marine creatures and plants. This reduces the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and amplifies the cooling of the Earth further. As the Earth’s orbit around the Sun shifts and the summers become warmer, the ice begins to melt and the opposite process occurs, leading to global warming.

The pace of today’s rise of CO2 levels in the atmosphere is much faster than for any glacial cycle. In the last 60 years alone, emissions from human activities using fossil fuels have caused CO2 levels to increase by about 100 parts per million, taking us to 410 parts per million in total. It took 10,000 years for CO2 levels to increase by 100 parts per million naturally, following the last Ice Age.

The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is also higher than at any other point in human history. The last time the world had a CO2 concentration of 410 parts per million was between 5.0–3.5 million years ago, when the world was 3–4 degrees warmer than today. Greenland and West Antarctica were free of ice and sea levels were 15–20 metres higher than today.",a

https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,"Human-caused emissions directly affect plants, as higher CO2 levels generally increase photosynthesis and plant growth. It is almost certainly because of this ‘fertilising’ effect that land ecosystems take up more than a quarter of the CO2 emitted by human activities[1].

Some crops, especially in temperate regions, are expected to grow faster and have higher yields as a result of such increases in CO2. However, because raised CO2 levels are also the cause of climate change, their impacts on plants are not straightforwardly positive. While crops in temperate regions could benefit from warmer weather during their growing season as a result of global warming, the effect of climate change impacts such as droughts and heat-stress are expected to have net negative impacts on crops in many warmer regions of the world[2].

Photosynthesis depends directly on the amount of light absorbed by leaves, and higher CO2 levels help plants use the light they absorb more efficiently to convert CO2 into biomass[3]. In addition, it also makes plants use water more efficiently. This improved efficiency increases vegetation cover – which further increases the amount of light plants absorb. These effects are part of the reason for an increase in green vegetation cover that can be seen from space; although intensive human use of land for growing crops, particularly in China and India, is also contributing to this ‘global greening’, and could account for up to a third or more of observed net increase in global vegetation cover[4].

Scientists have explored the effects of CO2 through experiments on ecosystems, including both forests and food crops. They show that increasing CO2 by a further 150–200 parts per million – up from today’s level of around 410 parts per million – increases the rate of photosynthesis in leaves growing under natural light conditions by around 12% on average[5],[6].

However, whether specific plants are able to grow faster as CO2 levels rise also depend on several other factors. Some plants – so-called C4 plants, including many tropical grasses, maize and sugarcane – have a mechanism that concentrates CO2 inside their leaves. This means higher CO2 concentrations will not increase their rates of photosynthesis and their growth. This is why yields for maize are not generally expected to increase[7] – except in dry areas where crops are not artificially supplied with water, and where the increased efficiency in using water (due to raised CO2) will benefit growth. Plants’ ability to grow faster in response to increased CO2 concentrations also depends on whether they can access the extra nutrients they need to grow more[8].

Non-C4 crops, like wheat, soybean and rice, can grow more in rising CO2 concentrations. In one sense, this phenomenon makes increasing CO2 levels ‘good’ for agriculture. On the other hand, risingCO2 levels are causing climate change, which is likely to have a harmful effect on crop growth, for example through heat-stress, especially in regions that are already warm. Future scenarios for crop yields suggest that we will see a mixed outcome, with higher average agricultural production in some regions, but increased risks of crop damage in other regions, particularly in the developing world[9].

The effects of raised CO2 concentrations on natural ecosystems are also not straightforwardly ‘good’ or ‘bad’. Rising CO2 levels tend to increase tree cover in grasslands, for example, which is ‘good’ for removing carbon from the air but ‘bad’ for grazing animals, as savannas become less grassy. And as raised CO2 levels makes plant water use more efficient, plant coverage can increase so much that it ends up using as much or even more water than before – which can add to the pressures on fresh water supplies in ecosystems with limited water[10].

That a higher level of CO2 has some positive effects on plant life does not change the fact that continued climate change will have increasingly harmful effects on many aspects of human activity across the globe, including crop growth and agriculture in warmer regions. The outcomes of policies to limit these impacts will take time to come into effect, which makes action towards net-zero emissions an urgent priority.",a
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,"How does climate change lead to sea level rise, and how will this impact coastal cities?",q
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,"As the world warms, ice sheets and glaciers on land melt and flow into the ocean. The ocean itself also warms and expands, as it absorbs significant amounts of the heat trapped by the greenhouse gas effect. These changes cause the sea level to rise.

Sea level rise continues to speed up as human-induced global warming increases. Sea levels were rising at a rate of around 8cm per 100 years in the late nineteenth century, 21cm per 100 years in the mid-twentieth century, and now up to around 32cm per 100 years. Future sea level rise depends on how quickly we reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.

However, the time lag between temperature rises and the melting of ice means we are already ‘locked in’ to a certain amount of future sea level rise. In a scenario where emissions are reduced rapidly and the rise in global temperatures stay below 2°C, sea level rise will still reach 29–59 cm in the next hundred years with respect to 1986-2005 levels[1]. This is because the effect of CO2 already in the atmosphere has a time lag; it heats the atmosphere slowly.

If emissions continue as they are, and ice-sheets respond to this in an expected manner, sea levels could rise by up by 1 m by 2100 compared to 1986-2005 levels[2]. This would bring serious risks for coastal regions around the world, including low-lying islands and major cities like Shanghai, Alexandria and Miami. More than half of the world’s largest cities lie along the coast[3], and just over 1 billion people live in coastal areas within 10 metres of sea level[4]. Adaptation measures can help protect these areas against serious risks of flooding if they go beyond maintaining today’s standards of protection and prepare for rising sea levels[5].   

The largest threat of future sea level rise comes from the possibility that the massive ice sheets in the Antarctic and Greenland could melt. In particular, the West Antarctic ice sheet is thought to be vulnerable to collapse. It rests on a bed more than 2 km below sea level and contains enough ice to raise global sea levels by around 3.5 m. In total, there is enough ice on the planet to raise sea levels by 70 m. It is difficult to predict at what level of warming this kind of dangerous change could occur, however the risk grows as global temperatures increase.  ",a
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,How will climate change impact our society?,q
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,"Climate change impacts our society by disrupting the natural, economic and social systems we depend on. This disruption will affect food supplies, industry supply chains and financial markets, damage infrastructure and cities, and harm human health and global development.

The impacts of climate change are already here. Global sea levels have risen 19cm since the beginning of the twentieth century, increasing the risk of flooding for many coastal cities and communities[1]. Heatwaves and droughts are becoming more common and more intense in many parts of the world, causing harm to human health and more heat-related deaths. Climate change is also affecting food security as rain and heat patterns change. In Southern Europe and some parts of Africa, Asia and South America, crop yields are declining[2].

In the UK, climate change is making some extreme weather events more frequent and more serious. The winter floods in 2013-14, which cost the economy £450 million in insured losses, occurred due to record rainfall in England and Wales[3] and were made more likely by climate change[4]. The European summer heatwave in 2018, which led to wildfires in parts of the UK, was made around 30 times more likely by climate change. Scientists now expect 12% of UK summers to experience the same levels of heat. Before global warming, the risk was less than 0.5%[5].

As the planet gets warmer, the impacts of climate change will grow. If emissions are not decreased and global warming reaches 4°C by 2100, sea levels in the UK could increase by around 1 m[6], which would put 3.3 million people at risk of flooding by 2050[7]. Global food supply would also be less secure as extreme weather events and habitat degradation disrupt supply chains. This could lead to higher food prices and up to 183 million more people in the world facing hunger[8].

Every bit of warming matters, and vulnerable populations and communities across the world have the greatest difficulty coping with the impacts. Even just half a degree of warming can make the difference between dangerous and manageable effects. By limiting global warming to 1.5°C instead of 2°C, for example, 420 million fewer people would be frequently exposed to extreme heatwaves, and 10 million fewer people would be at risk of flooding from rising sea levels[9].

These risks and impacts are not evenly distributed, and some regions of the planet will feel the effects of climate change more severely than others depending on their location and ability to adapt. However, because both the climate system and our human societies are globally interconnected, the effects of climate change will impact all countries, companies and communities in some way.",a
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,What are the impacts of climate change on the economy?,q
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,"The physical impacts of climate change will affect most aspects of human welfare and the economy[1].  In some regions of the world, rising temperatures will harm worker productivity and crop yields, and lead to more cardiovascular and respiratory problems and higher mortality rates; although cold-related mortality rates are likely to fall[2].  Meanwhile, higher sea levels will flood cities, storms will become more damaging, rivers will dry up, glacier-fed water supplies will diminish, and ecosystems will suffer.

Calculations of the costs of these changes are mostly given as a top-level, global average. They are usually given in relation to GDP (‘gross domestic product’) a measure of economic income that is not entirely clear to most of us. GDP is the total economic value of all goods and services produced within a country in a given period; it is used as a standard measure of economic performance.

Some attempts to calculate the total costs of climate change suggest that if the global average temperature increase is kept below 2°C, it will cause economic impacts that are less than 1% of global GDP[3]. In 2017, 1% of global GDP was $800 billion (£648 billion). If temperatures rise further, however, the costs of climate change would increase rapidly. One study suggests unmitigated global warming could reduce average global incomes roughly 23% by 2100, and make 77% of countries poorer in per capita terms than they would be without climate change[4].

Calculating economic impacts in these average values, however, hides many of the most important issues related to the costs of climate change. Firstly, calculations are hugely uncertain and often do not represent all major risks. Secondly, economic impacts measured in terms of the effects on global GDP look very different at the level of individual countries, and of individual people.

This is because the social and economic impacts of climate change will be distributed unevenly around the world. Some areas will be completely devastated by climate change, such as low-lying islands and coastal towns, and economies that depend a lot on agriculture. These areas are often the poorest parts of the world, where millions are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, and their economies will be hit the hardest. People living in poverty are the least able to adapt to warming, and small changes in their income due to climate change-related events can result in overwhelming losses to welfare and livelihoods[5].  Calculations at the level of GDP can hide these impacts. 

Ultimately, some of the greatest risks are also the ones for which we cannot calculate the costs yet. The climate system has several thresholds and ‘tipping points’, where small differences in temperature can create sudden, unexpected and permanent changes with global consequences. Examples include the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet, dieback of the Amazon, failures of the Indian monsoon, and the weakening of Atlantic thermohaline circulation[6].  

Even though these events are individually unlikely, they would have wide-ranging and serious impacts that represent huge economic and social risks. Major changes like these would increase the potential for conflict, political upheaval and mass displacement[7].  ",a
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,How do we meet the Paris Agreement temperature goal?,q
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,"The Paris Agreement temperature goal is to keep global warming ‘well below 2°C’, and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C. This goal provides clear guidance that the maximum level of warming should be as far below 2°C as possible, and that limiting it to 1.5°C would significantly reduce risks and impacts[1],[2]. As the global average temperature has already warmed by 1°C since 1850, limiting warming to 1.5°C equates to only a further 0.5°C of warming.

To stop global warming at any level, total CO2 emissions must be kept to within a specific carbon budget. Staying within a limited carbon budget can only be achieved if annual global CO2 emissions are eventually reduced to net-zero levels – balancing sources and removal of emissions from the atmosphere.

To limit warming to 1.5°C, we need to reach net zero carbon emissions globally by the middle of this century; although if achieved, this still delivers only around a 50% chance that warming will not exceed 1.5°C[3]. Limiting warming to 1.5°C will only be possible if global emissions peak within the next few years, and then start to decline rapidly, halving by 2030. To achieve this, we must transform all sectors of our economy and create a zero-carbon society[3],[4],[5].

We already have the tools to implement most of the solutions. They include shifting away from fossil fuels and to renewables and other zero-carbon energy sources; cutting emissions from agriculture, including by enabling changes towards more plant-based diets; massively increasing energy efficiency measures to eliminate wasted energy; changing farming practices and land use; decarbonising industrial processes; creating zero carbon transport and heating systems; and embracing a ‘circular economy' of recycling and reusing.

https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,Why is it so urgent that we act on climate change now?,q
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,"Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities have already increased the surface temperature of the planet by about 1°C since around 1850[1]. To avoid warming beyond 1.5°C – the lower end of the temperature target in the Paris Agreement – global emissions need to reach their peak immediately and then fall drastically within the next decade. If emissions stay at current levels, or continue to grow if we do not take action, global warming is likely to exceed 1.5°C between 2030 and 2050.

The impacts of 1°C of warming are already being felt across the globe and will become more severe with additional warming[1]. Even with 1.5°C of warming, climate change will have dangerous effects, such as severe heatwaves that could affect more than 1 billion people once every five years on average[2].

If warming goes beyond 1.5°C, humans face much more dangerous potential impacts. At 2°C of warming, 1.7 billion more people would be exposed to severe heatwaves at least once every five years than at 1.5°C[2]. In addition, sea levels could rise by up to 43cm by 2100[3], increasing the risks of flooding in coastal regions and cities in the UK and globally[3].

If emissions continue to rise, the risk of reaching a level of warming that triggers irreversible effects would also grow. Destabilisation of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, for example, could eventually raise sea levels by up to 10 m globally, with profound effects for coastal cities and communities.

Halting global warming requires putting a limit on the total amount of CO2 that human activities can emit, called a ‘carbon budget’. Humans have already emitted about 2,200 billion tonnes of CO2 since preindustrial times[1], [4]. We now have a small carbon budget of around 420 billion tonnes of CO2 left to emit globally from 2018 onwards, if we want a 66% chance of limiting warming to 1.5°C, and 580 billion tonnes CO2 for a 50% chance[1], [5].

We currently emit about 42 billion tonnes of CO2 per year globally[1]. To stay within the global carbon budget, the world needs to halve its current emissions by 2030 and reduce net global CO2 emissions to net zero by 2050; a challenge that can only be met if emissions reductions start now. If emissions do not decline rapidly to half their current level by 2030, they must decline faster afterwards and would likely require ‘negative emissions’, which means directly removing CO2 from the atmosphere. This increases the risk of not stopping warming at the necessary level.

Another reason for acting on climate change immediately is the time it takes to overcome challenges when deploying new technologies and rolling out new policies. We can implement many potential policies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to bring about substitution of renewables in place of fossil fuels; putting a price on greenhouse gas emissions; and introducing measures that encourage changes in dietary choices, boost energy efficiency and promote electric transport[6], [7], [5], [8].

These changes will come with new social, economic and environmental benefits. Switching to a more plant-based balanced diet, for example, will have benefits for human health; and more electric transport options will improve air quality. All these measures, however, also come with challenges that will make them more or less likely to succeed. We need to act on climate change immediately to gain the experience of what works and what needs adjusting.",a
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,"Why do we talk about ‘net-zero’ instead of just ‘zero’ emissions, and what are negative emissions?",q
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,"Even if we put in place all possible ways to reduce global emissions immediately, it is unlikely we can phase out all the activities that emit CO2 by the middle of the century; which is necessary to have at least a 50% chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C[1],[2],[3]. For some activities, like cement and steel production, aviation and shipping, we may not have the solutions needed to make them fully emissions-free by that time. That means we will need strategies to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.

This is why we talk about ‘net zero’ rather than just zero emissions. Net zero refers to the idea of balancing emissions from human activities with ways of removing emissions from the atmosphere. A target for achieving net zero emissions clarifies that some ‘residual emissions’ will remain from sectors where it would be impossible to fully phase out their emissions by mid-century. This is either because we lack the solutions to do so, or because their activities by design imply emissions followed by removals, such as in sustainable forestry where felling a tree releases CO2 and planting a new one works to absorb it again.

These residual emissions would then be removed from the atmosphere to reach net zero; what is called ‘negative emissions’. An example of a technology for achieving negative emissions is Direct Air Capture (DAC), which captures CO2 from the atmosphere and transforms it to a form that can be used or stored. Planting more trees that soak up the excess CO2 is another way to remove emissions from the atmosphere, although the effect would only take place years to decades after planting and would be vulnerable to events like forest fires.

The amount of negative emissions we will need depends on the global strategy for tackling climate change that the world’s countries choose to follow. If emissions decrease significantly in the next decade, countries can minimise the amount of CO2 that would need to be removed in order to meet the Paris Agreement goals[4],[5],[2],[3].

Relying on negative emissions strategies also comes with risks. Many of the technologies are not yet commercially viable, and their large-scale use could use and their large-scale use could conflict with other goals for sustainable development[6].

Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), for example, relies on planting large amounts of trees and plants that absorb CO2 as they grow. The plant material is then burned to produce bioenergy, and the carbon dioxide that is produced is captured and stored instead of released into the atmosphere. However, this could require large amounts of land and create risks for biodiversity conservation, land rights or food production if not managed adequately[7].

https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,How have the world’s nations agreed to act on climate change?,q
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,"In December 2015, 194 states and the European Union signed up to the Paris Agreement. This is the most important pact for international cooperation to tackle climate change[1]. By signing the Agreement, the world’s nations have committed to limit the increase in global warming to 'well below 2°C', with a goal to keep it to 1.5°C[2].

They also set an aim for global emissions to peak as soon as possible, and then achieve a balance between human emissions produced and the removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere in the second half on the century; resulting in what is called ‘net zero emissions’. Developed countries have also committed to provide more financial support for developing countries to act on climate change.

By signing the Agreement, countries have committed to submitting and delivering on their own voluntary  pledges that set out how they will lower their emissions and adapt to climate change. These are known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The pledges are monitored through an international mechanism that reviews collective progress on the goals of the Agreement. This is the ‘global stocktake’ which will first happen in 2023, and then subsequently every five years. 

Countries are legally bound to submit their pledges under the Paris Agreement. Delivering the pledges, however, must be ensured and enforced through national laws and policies. By publicising the different national pledges transparently, the Agreement makes it possible to hold states accountable if they fail to deliver on their promises. The global stocktake mechanism also puts pressure on countries to increase their level of ambition over time, by regularly reviewing progress on the shared global goals.

This approach is part of the reason why international relations experts have suggested that the Paris Agreement was an important new step for global climate change action[3]. By relying on voluntary promises and transparent review processes, it sidesteps the thorny question of how to reach an international agreement on legally binding targets for lowering greenhouse gas emissions. It is hoped that this approach creates a more realistic path for international climate change action[4].

Taken together, however, the current NDCs of all nations are not enough to put the world on track to limit global warming to ‘well below 2°C’[1].

Instead, analysis published by the United Nations Environment Programme estimates that the current NDC pledges for 2025/2030 are consistent with a global emissions pathway that would lead to a world that is 3°C warmer on average at the end of the century, than it was at pre-industrial levels[2]. This is far from being in line with the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit warming to well below 2°C and pursue best efforts to keep it to 1.5°C. To close the gap to 2°C, countries need to collectively triple the currently planned cuts in their emissions[2].

The Paris Agreement explicitly requires each country to revise its pledge and increase its ambition every five years, effectively creating what is called a ‘ratchet mechanism’. Countries agreed at the Paris climate change summit in 2015 to submit revised NDCs by 2021 at the latest, at the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP26) which will be held in Glasgow, UK, and was postponed from its original date of 2020 due to COVID-19. It is expected that countries will pledge new and more ambitious NDCs ahead of COP26 and bring their actual plans for emissions reductions by 2025/2030 into line with the targets of the Paris Agreement.

Steps in the right direction are also being taken by countries that set targets for reaching net-zero emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Sweden and Norway were some of the first countries to legally commit to net-zero targets, and the UK was the first of the G7 major economies to do so with a commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, closely followed by France. In 2020, China committed to reaching carbon neutrality by 2060, while South Korea and Japan committed to net zero emissions by 2050. Chile and Fiji are also among the countries to have proposed net zero targets, which are pending legislation[4].

Actually reaching these targets, however, requires rolling out credible policies for reducing emissions immediately. While the UK has set a target for net-zero emissions by 2050, it is currently not set to meet its emission reduction targets for the periods 2023-27 and 2028-2032 respectively. While emissions in the UK power sector have reduced significantly, policies across the rest of the economy are not on track to lower emissions as needed[5].",a

https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,"Avoiding climate change risks and their damages requires creating a zero-carbon economic and societal transformation. This involves developing and rolling out both new inventions and existing zero-carbon technologies such as renewable energy generators like wind and solar; batteries for energy storage and electric vehicles to replace petrol and diesel vehicles; businesses and homes switching away from fossil-fuel based energy sources; and people making different choices about what they buy and how they live.

The most important financial benefits of these actions come from avoiding the disastrous effect that the impacts of climate change would have on our society. Limiting increases in the frequency and intensity of flooding, heatwaves, wildfires and other extreme weather events can help avoid the otherwise major costs of adaptation to these impacts - the UK winter floods in 2013-14, which resulted from heavy rainfall that was made more likely by climate change, cost the economy £450 million in insured losses alone, for example[1].

To understand the full economic impact acting on climate change, however, economists also look at the multiple gains and benefits that come from creating a zero-carbon society, beyond limiting the risks presented by climate change.

The economic costs of acting on climate change

Many of the changes needed to achieve a zero-carbon society will create an initial cost to sectors of the economy. High-carbon companies are likely to lose competitiveness in the transition, as infrastructure for the zero-carbon economy is built and policy incentives are rolled out.

In the UK, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) suggests that reaching net zero emissions by 2050 could cost up to 1-2% of GDP per year by 2050. That’s roughly equivalent to about £50 billion each year by 2050. For comparison, the UK’s military defence budget is currently about 2% of GDP each year[2].

At a global level, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that limiting warming to 2°C would reduce the growth rate of per capita global consumption by around 0.06 percentage points annually, compared with growth in a hypothetical world with no climate change[3]. On the other hand, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) argues that tackling climate change as part of a transition that also involves structural reform and fiscal initiatives could add 1% to GDP in G20 countries by 2021, and 2.8% by 2050[4].

The large differences between these figures shows why it is so difficult to make long-term predictions about the costs of acting on climate change, and why any projection is always uncertain. Ultimately, the future is not a given and how exactly costs play out will depend on the decisions and investments made today and over the entire zero-carbon transition.

It is clear, however, that for the UK, the costs will be lower and the benefits higher, if the country proactively acts to tackle climate change[5]. It is also clear that the costs of many zero-carbon technologies, such as solar energy, wind power and batteries, have reduced significantly over the past few years, making the transition cheaper[6].

Costs without benefits is only half the story

Many calculations of the economic costs of tackling climate change do not account for the economic benefits that will also come from taking action. This means they only tell one part of the story, as the benefits of tackling climate change will likely outweigh the costs[7].

Some of these benefits will come from positive effects on our health. Phasing out the burning of fossil fuels will bring down air pollution levels and switching to diets with less red meat and more plants make for healthier diets. Enabling changes like these will lead to healthier people and cost savings for healthcare systems like the National Health Service[8].

Benefits also include avoiding the cost of damage caused by climate change and extreme weather events. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) suggests that if economic benefits of avoiding climate damages, such as increased flooding, droughts and extreme weather events, are also taken into account, taking action on climate change alongside pro-growth policies could add almost 5% to GDP in G20 countries by 2050[9].

Transitioning to a zero-carbon society will also lead to new economic and industrial opportunities. As bringing down greenhouse gas emissions becomes the norm, businesses will compete to offer new, low-carbon technologies, goods and services such as offshore wind power, high-capacity batteries and advisory services for low-emissions urban planning. Companies that are successful in establishing this advantage early on, can access the new market opportunities that come from the need to reduce emissions in other sectors or in other countries. This can bring new benefits to the economy.  

Countries like the UK, which are good at many areas of innovation, can benefit especially from the fact that a zero-carbon economy relies on new technological developments, bringing new industrial opportunities when supportive policies are in place. In the UK, zero- and low-carbon goods and services already represent one of the fastest-growing parts of the economy. In 2017, businesses active in the low-carbon and renewable energy economy employed 396,200 people and had a direct and indirect combined turnover of £79.6bn, an increase of 8.2% compared with the previous year and growing faster than the whole of the UK business economy, which grew 5.6% over the same period[10],[11].",a

https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,"The financial costs and benefits of achieving net-zero emissions will be distributed in different ways across different parts of the economy and among consumers. When making decisions about how to fund the United Kingdom’s transition to net-zero emissions by 2050, policymakers will need to consider how to avoid costs falling unfairly on vulnerable consumers and households[1].

Stopping emissions requires a shift in both public and private spending. The government will need to create policies that incentivise people to spend their money differently, such as by switching to decarbonised heating in their homes and transport options like electric vehicles. At the same time, shifts in public spending and new financial incentives are needed to drive the development of innovative zero-carbon technologies, increase energy efficiency in buildings, change farming practices and create a clean energy system.

Current government policies support investment in renewable power through direct subsidies, which are funded through household and business energy bills, and through additional charges on electricity generated from fossil fuels. Economists expect the prices of electricity and heating to rise during the 2020s, until the needed infrastructure to supply clean energy for electricity and heat is entirely built and operational[2].

Currently, however, higher electricity and gas prices from subsidising zero-carbon technologies is outweighed by savings made through improvements to energy efficiency. The total annual electricity and gas bill for a UK household fell £115 in real terms between 2008 and 2016, a trend which could continue through the 2020s as households further balance higher gas and electricity prices with greater savings from more efficient energy use[3].

The Committee on Climate Change suggests that future costs to households of switching to clean energy in the home, particularly for heating, are also likely to be offset by falling costs elsewhere. For example, the shift to electric vehicles will lead to lower transport costs for households, as electric vehicles are likely to become cheaper to drive than petrol or diesel vehicles in the mid-2020s. Falling costs of renewable power between 2030 and 2050 are also expected to make the average electricity bill cheaper than it is today[4].

Despite these benefits, economists suggest that the transition to a zero-carbon society, particularly if funded by household energy bills, could be ‘regressive’ because poorer households tend to spend a higher proportion of their income on energy costs; and so decarbonisation imposes a greater proportional burden on them than on wealthy households[5],[6].

Policies such as carbon taxes and emissions trading systems follow the ‘polluter pays’ principle and put a price on the carbon emissions from households and businesses. Although making polluters pay seems fair, these policies also hit low-income households harder.  Fortunately, it is possible to address this issue through rebate schemes that pay back at least some of the collected revenues to poorer households.

Such schemes could potentially work either through the current benefit system, providing support to lower-income households to improve poorly insulated homes, or through a new ‘carbon dividend’ for every household that would return revenues to each household, often benefiting those on lower incomes[7].",a

https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,"Economic models help us analyse pathways to a zero-carbon future. They are used to test how the economy could respond to different future circumstances, and how existing or possible future technologies could help meet targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in different sectors. This helps us compare the costs of different policies to reduce emissions, and the risks and uncertainties that come with each option. However, economic models also have limitations which are important to keep in mind when interpreting their results. 

Economic models currently are sometimes used to guide policy decisions about climate change. The most common type used are Integrated Assessment Models. These attempt to capture how economic and societal choices, and technological developments, could interact with the climate system and natural world. However, because models often predict the future based on knowledge about the past, calculations of what it could cost to reduce emissions are always just one version of a possible future, based on very specific assumptions. 

Economic models have been criticised for badly representing real-world technology development. They often fail to take account of the process of disruptive technological change and as a result tend to underestimate the rate at which costs can fall. For example, the rate and pace of cost reductions for solar energy were underestimated by models, as government subsidies and the response to them have driven widespread deployment. Solar photovoltaics are now well placed to outcompete new coal power plants as a source of power almost everywhere in the world[1]. This makes it much cheaper to cut emissions from electricity generation than models predicted it would be by now.

Economic models can also struggle to incorporate the major future risks of dangerous climate change, as these are hard to quantify and capture[2]. Many models do not include the economic implications of reaching a level of global warming that would create irreversible global changes, such as collapse of ecosystems, melting of entire ice sheets and extreme heat events. By not modelling these risks, our predictions of the possible economic impacts of climate change excludes some of the events that represent the greatest threat to human livelihoods, development and economic growth.

What economic models do tell us is that the longer we wait, and the less coherently we manage the transition to a zero-carbon society, the higher the costs are likely to be[3]. Estimates of the costs of acting on climate change are also only one part of the equation, but when combined with analysis of the benefits of acting on climate change, they become useful parts of the toolkit for understanding our options for action. Models can also help us think about the implications of taking action at different timescales, when to introduce policy measures in different sectors and which policies are effective it at the lowest possible cost.",a
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,Why can we not just adapt to climate change? Is that not cheaper than reducing emissions?,q
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,"Adapting to the impacts and risks of living in a changed climate is an essential part of tackling climate change. However, in no way does it replace the need to urgently reduce emissions as well. In fact, the rate and speed of emissions reductions determines how effectively we can adapt to the impacts of climate change. If emissions do not decrease, it will be much harder, perhaps even impossible, to adapt as the impacts will arrive more quickly and at a more rapidly increasing scale.

Effective adaptation will help people, businesses, communities and countries cope with both the currently-happening and future impacts of climate change. Measures like flood protection and changes to land-use, as well as the ways we construct buildings, can help minimise damages to human livelihoods and the economy.

The sooner we roll out effective measures, the earlier we benefit from avoided damages. As global warming increases, the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events will grow and impact food security, nature, cities and jobs in more harmful ways[1]. This means more adaptation is required, at greater cost, and can increase the risk of irreversible loss that it is impossible to adapt to, such as extinction of species and submergence of low-laying islands or cities due to sea level rise. 

Calculations of the exact future costs of adaptation produce a variety of results, as they depend strongly on the level of future greenhouse gas emissions and how the climate system will respond to them in different places, and whether they are effective. This makes accurately predicting the economic costs and benefits of adaptation very difficult. It is clear, however, that adaptation without efforts to stop climate change would prove extremely expensive.

The World Bank estimates the costs of adapting to 2°C of warming by 2050 might be $75–100 billion a year (£60-80 billion) for developing countries[2]. However, these figures are almost certainly too low[3]. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) suggests that the cost of adapting to climate change in developing countries could reach between $280 and $500 billion (£217 - £388 billion) per year by 2050, with 2°C of warming[4]. If warming increases beyond this level, the costs of adaptation would increase significantly as well.

Investing in adaptation is essential to limit the damages of climate change impacts on human society. However, any effective strategy to tackle climate change must both cut emissions to limit future warming and adapt to those impacts of climate change that cannot be avoided. The Global Commission on Adaptation states that even the most ambitious adaptation plans will not protect us against all the impacts of climate change. That is why lowering emissions is “the best form of adaptation”[5].

https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,"What types of investments are needed to create a zero-carbon, climate-resilient economy and how are they different from current investments?",q
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,"Creating a zero-carbon, climate-resilient economy involves changing our buildings and our transport, energy and water systems. To achieve this, new investments in efficient and clean infrastructure - which is also resilient to climate change impacts - are crucial[1],[2].

Total worldwide investments in infrastructure are set to double across the next twenty years as the world’s population increases, urbanisation continues and both developed and developing countries grow[3],[4],[5]. China alone is expected to invest up to US$30 trillion in infrastructure by 2040, which would represent more than half of Asia’s currently identified needs and 30% of global investment[6].

We need this infrastructure to be fit for a zero-carbon and climate-resilient world rather than locking us into a high-carbon economy. This involves investing in new sustainable infrastructure and retrofitting the old, alongside a rapid phase-out and halting of new investment in infrastructure that involves the unabated burning of fossil fuels, particularly coal power plants[7],[8]. One study suggests that to meet the Paris Agreement target of keeping global warming to well below 2°C, total investments in low- and zero-carbon technologies would have to multiply by a factor of ten between 2016 and 2050[9]. The pace at which coal power plants are closing would also have to be doubled immediately[10].

Investment in zero-carbon infrastructure forms the structures we need to create a low-carbon economy, such as new transport systems that are designed for electric or hydrogen-powered vehicles. While this is not expected to be more costly than fossil-fuel based infrastructure in the long run, large upfront investments are required. Such investments also have broader benefits, beyond helping to avoid the impacts of climate change. Smart, clean and modern power networks reduce air pollution and waste and upgrading industrial processes to zero-carbon alternatives can their increase efficiency and lower production costs[11].

Investments in zero-carbon infrastructure also present new opportunities for economic development and growth. With the costs of renewable energy technologies, such as solar panels and wind turbines, rapidly falling and global demand growing, countries that lead in developing zero-carbon infrastructure can benefit from the expansion of new markets across the world. Countries and financial institutions that do this will also avoid the economic risk of developing high-carbon infrastructure that ends up losing its value and becoming obsolete before investors have seen a return, what is known as a ‘stranded asset’[12].

Sustainable infrastructure investment is also essential to make our cities, ecosystems and ways of life resilient to a more hostile climate, with more frequent and intense extreme weather events in many parts of the world[13],[14]. As these events increase in severity, the risks of damage to infrastructure grows, which could cause harm to people and mean high costs from repairing and rebuilding.

A major flood or storm event, for example, can render large areas of a city uninhabitable until vital infrastructure for services like electricity and water networks are up and running again. This can cause extended financial losses for businesses and can have serious consequences for national economies[15],[16]. Adapting our infrastructure to withstand those impacts of a changing climate that now cannot be avoided is essential to limit harmful impacts on both people and the economy; and it can lead to people’s greater well-being and sustained economic development as well[17].

https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,Does tackling climate change prevent the reduction of poverty?,q
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,"The impacts of climate change do not affect everyone in the same way. Developing countries, and in particularly poor people in those countries, suffer disproportionately from floods, heatwaves, worsening crop yields and sea level rise, as they are financially less able to adapt to such changes[1]. This makes climate change a factor that threatens people’s ability to emerge from poverty.

Failing to address climate change would as such make it harder to address poverty[2]. If emissions are not reduced and the impacts of climate change become more severe, people in poverty will be worse off. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) considers the unfair distribution of climate change impacts one of its “main reasons for concern”; a risk that grows as global warming increases[3].

At the same time, eradicating poverty means ensuring that policies that aim to tackle climate change do not impose short-term costs on those people that are least able to afford it. It also raises the question of whether developing countries would be limited in their economic growth if they reduce their emissions immediately, as fossil-fuel based energy has historically helped countries towards faster development[4].

It is increasingly clear, however, that ‘growing first and cleaning up later’ is not an effective approach to economic growth in developing nations. Instead, addressing climate change is likely to create new opportunities for growth and jobs, aligning with other development objectives rather than challenging them[5].

For example, for energy consumers, constantly falling costs mean electricity from renewable energy is now often more cost-effective than electricity from fossil fuels. This is particularly the case in rural areas where local electricity demand is low and widely spread. Here, distributed energy solutions – such as community-led solar “mini-grids” – are often the cheapest and easiest ways to install sources of power and increase access to electricity, and they have health benefits such as bringing down air pollution levels as well[6].

As developing countries invest heavily in infrastructure to grow their economies, they also have a major opportunity to invest in sustainable assets up front. Infrastructure projects like energy systems are designed for longevity, which means building clean and resilient infrastructure now avoids the need to replace it later as part of the global effort to tackle climate change[7]. This makes the zero-carbon transition cheaper in the long run. At the same time, adapting infrastructure to the future risks of climate change will also make people in poverty less vulnerable to climate shocks[8].   ",a
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,Will acting on climate change cause difficulties for some communities and industries as the economy changes?,q
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,"To tackle climate change, it is necessary to cut greenhouse gas emissions drastically across all parts of the economy. This transformation presents major opportunities, with the Wold Bank suggesting that a zero-carbon economy will likely be more prosperous than a high-carbon economy in the long run[1].

However, managing the transition means recognising there will be winners and losers. Inevitably, some industries – such as the oil and gas sectors – will decline or majorly transform[2]. Workers in these industries, the communities where they live, and other businesses that rely on them, face risks if the transition is not carefully considered.  

Some countries will also face greater difficulties than others, especially those that depend on fossil fuels. In India, for example, royalties from coal make up almost 50% of revenues for some states, which means the economy could be particularly hard hit from a transition to clean power[3].

This is why creating a just transition is so essential. To urgently act on climate change, the shift to a zero-carbon economy must bring everyone with it, and governments have an important role to play in creating policies that ensure this happens.

There are many lessons from previous industrial transitions on how to manage the shift, in particular for the fossil fuel sector. These show that implementing policies early can help to manage the decline of industries. Alongside a long-term vision to support growth in new industries in those regions, this can help avoid harming workers’ livelihoods and communities that rely on specific industries. Such a managed transition requires close collaboration between a country’s government, local authorities, businesses and labour unions[4].

Supporting affected workers through wage guarantees, pension rights, healthcare benefits, cash transfers and early retirement packages can also help smooth the transition in the short-term. in the medium term, government and business investment in skills and retraining for workers to enter new industries can help prevent industrial decline. In the long run, government and businesses can invest in education and innovation, and grow industries that create long-term prosperity in a green economy[5].",a
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,Do we have an ethical obligation to stop climate change?,q
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/,"Climate change will harm both current and future generations by limiting their access to a safe and prosperous world. For this reason, stopping climate change can be viewed as an ethical duty for current generations to not profoundly damage the prospects of future generations[1]. Concepts of ‘justice’ are also debated intensely within international climate change negotiations, as the question of how to distribute responsibilities for tackling climate change is in many ways about deciding what is ‘fair’ based on individual countries’ circumstances, historical role in creating emissions and how vulnerable they are to climate change impacts.

The fact that future generations will be exposed to more severe impacts of climate change - but are not able to participate in decision-making today about how to limit and avoid those future impacts – can be viewed as a question of intergenerational justice[2]. This is the notion that as our present choices have the power to influence the options and possibilities available to future generations, we are obliged to consider the future impact of these choices.

A failure to decrease emissions of greenhouse gases today would mean future generations have no choice but to face severe and harmful climate impacts in the future. Young people across the world have protested this unfair distribution through global school strikes. Religious writings, such as from the Pope and Islamic leaders, have also pointed out that as humans are stewards of the Earth, we are responsible for protecting it as our common home for both current and future generations[3],[4].

In addition, international climate negotiations have taken into account the need for fairness between developing and developed countries in acting on climate change. The Paris Agreement states that its Parties are guided by “the principle of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances”. It also recognises “the specific needs and special circumstances of developing country Parties, especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change”[5].

Deciding on a fair distribution of responsibility has been contentious in climate negotiations. Some countries, like the UK, have made a major contribution to global emissions since the start of the industrial revolution, while others, such as India, have only recently become major emitters. This difference creates a strong sense of injustice in developing nations, if they believe that they are being asked to make the same contributions to cutting emissions as countries with a larger historical responsibility for emissions; and which are also richer because of economic development and growth that led to these emissions[6].

Going beyond historical responsibility, the idea of ‘capability’ is another way to determine a fair distribution of action between countries. This approach suggests the most financially or technologically capable countries should be responsible for acting most urgently to reduce emissions. This gives less capable countries a reduced responsibility for immediately lowering emissions, and is another reason some suggest it is fair for industrialised countries to lead efforts to tackle climate change.

Both the UK’s large historical responsibility for causing climate change and its strong ability to act - as a wealthy, developed nation - are among the reasons why the Committee on Climate Change suggested it was fair for the UK to reach net zero emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050[7].",a

Believe it or not, cows’ eating habits contribute towards climate change. Just like us, when cows eat, methane – a type of greenhouse gas – builds up in their digestive system and is released in the form of… a burp! This might sound funny, but when you imagine that there are almost 1.5 billion cows releasing all that gas into the atmosphere, it sure adds up! Forests absorb huge amounts of carbon dioxide – another greenhouse gas – from the air, and release oxygen back into it. The Amazon rainforest is so large and efficient at doing this that it acts like our planet’s air conditioner – limiting climate change. Sadly, many rainforests are being cut down to make wood, palm oil and to clear the way for farmland, roads, oil mines, and dams.

Polar animals – whose icy natural habitat is melting in the warmer temperatures – are particularly at risk. In fact, experts believe that the Arctic sea ice is melting at a shocking rate – 9% per decade! Polar bears need sea ice to be able to hunt, raise their young and as places to rest after long periods of swimming. Certain seal species, like ringed seals make caves in the snow and ice to raise their pups, feed and mate.
It’s not just polar animals who are in trouble. Apes like orangutans, which live in the rainforests of Indonesia, are under threat as their habitat is cut down, and more droughts cause more bushfires.  

Sea turtles rely on nesting beaches to lay their eggs, many of which are threatened by rising sea levels. Did you know that the temperature of nests determines whether the eggs are male or female? Unfortunately, with temperatures on the rise, this could mean that many more females are born than males, threatening future turtle populations.",a

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What is fossil fuel divestment?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Divestment is the opposite of investment – it is the removal of stocks, bonds or funds from certain sectors or companies. The global movement for fossil fuel divestment (sometimes also called disinvestment) is asking institutions to move their money out of oil, coal and gas companies for both moral and financial reasons. These institutions include universities, religious institutions, pension funds, local authorities and charitable foundations.

Evidence shows that proven fossil fuel reserves are more than three times higher than we can afford to burn in order to stay below the generally agreed threshold for dangerous climate change. Fossil fuel companies are currently banking on extracting these reserves and selling them – and are actively prospecting for more. By supporting these companies, investors not only continue to fund unsustainable business models that are bound to make climate change worse, but they also risk their financial assets becoming worthless if international agreements on climate change are met. These investments are creating a “carbon bubble” worth trillions of dollars based on assets that could prove to be unusable. The Bank of England is conducting an investigation into whether these over-valued assets could plunge the world into another economic crisis. Although the impact of divestment on share prices may be relatively small, the reputational damage can have serious financial consequences.

Since 2010, the movement for fossil fuel divestment, started by 350.org, has persuaded 180 institutions, worth $50bn (£33bn) to divest, with Stanford University in the US, Glasgow University in the UK and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund among the most notable.

It is the fastest growing divestment campaign in history and could cause significant damage to coal, gas and oil companies according to a study by Oxford University. Previous divestment campaigns have targeted the tobacco and gambling industries and companies funding the violence in Darfur. Divestment is perhaps most well known for its role in the fight against apartheid in South Africa.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What are the potential impacts of climate change for the UK?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Temperatures in the UK have risen by about one degree since the 1970s and, given the levels of greenhouse gas already in the atmosphere, further warming is inevitable over the next three decades or so. The amount of warming will depend on future emissions but even if emissions are cut quickly and sharply to avoid dangerous levels of climate change, there will be some unavoidable impacts that the UK will have to adapt to.

The government's latest climate change risk assessment identifies flood risk, and particularly flooding from heavy downpours, as one of the key climate threats for the UK, alongside stresses on water resources, threats to biodiversity and natural habitats, and the repercussions for the UK from climate change impacts abroad.

Computer models that simulate the climate suggest that, as a result of warming, extremely wet winters could become up to five times more likely over the next 100 years, with more intense downpours in the winter months driving a greater risk of flash floods and river flooding, alongside risks from sea-level rise. Extreme flood events such as those in the summer of 2007 could become more frequent and severe, putting homes, businesses and infrastructure at greater risk. The government estimates that annual damages from flooding alone could increase to between £2bn and £12bn by the 2080s, an increase of about two to 10 times compared with current-day estimates. Critical infrastructure, including water-pumping stations, water treatment works, transport and electricity systems, and schools and hospitals sited in flood-risk areas could also be threatened, while heavy rainfall events could increase the risk of water contamination should sewers overflow. Current government estimates suggest about 330,000 properties are currently at risk of flooding, and climate change could increase this to between 630,000 and 1.2m by the 2080s.

Conversely, the models suggest that the UK could experience warmer, drier summers in the future. While that may bring some benefits, it could mean increased risk of drought, and extreme events such as the 2003 heatwave could be the norm by the end of this century. Heatwaves could also heighten pressure on healthcare services, because older populations are more vulnerable to extreme heat, and impact on transport, as higher summer temperatures bring the threat of rail buckling and associated travel delays.

The UK could also face threats to its water security and supply. Declining summer river flows, reduced groundwater replenishment and increased evaporation could all contribute to water loss, which could result in water shortages and restrictions on usage. The government estimates that 27-59 million people could be living in areas affected by water supply deficits by the 2050s, even before considering increasing populations and rising water demand.

Ecosystems are also highly vulnerable to climate change, which can aggravate existing stress factors such as pollution, land conversion and invasive non-native species. While some species could benefit from climate change, far more are set to lose out, according to the latest government estimates.

The UK may see changing patterns of wildlife and plants as species try to adapt by moving northwards, or have to compete with new non-native species. Habitats may come under increasing pressure – from salt marsh threatened by sea-level rise to beech woodland susceptible to summer droughts. Species could also experience reduced food supply if earlier breeding periods are at odds with the food available at the time.

None of the model predictions are certain. There is a lot that science does not yet know, and wider social and economic trends will also affect the UK's vulnerability to the effects of climate change. These range from an ageing population – with greater vulnerability to extreme heat – to population growth and increasing household and industry demand for water, which is expected to be 5% higher by 2020 compared with today. With 13% of new homes built since 2000 constructed on floodplains (that's about 10,000–16,000 new homes a year), planning decisions are another factor that can worsen the UK's existing vulnerabilities.

Recent reports by the UK Government Foresight programme and PWC suggest that the impacts of climate change outside the UK could have a larger effect on the British economy than the impacts felt within the country. If, for example, climate impacts led to international instability or reductions in the supply raw materials or commodities, the UK could experience effects ranging from increased food price volatility (if crop patterns change globally) to changing migration patterns as environmental refugees move from areas affected by extreme weather events.

Nevertheless, the UK could see some gains from climate change. While summer deaths could increase given the predicted increase in hot days and heatwaves, the country could see a fall in the number of cold-related deaths – estimated to be in the region of 3,900 to 24,000 premature cold deaths avoided each year by 2050. Providing water is available in sufficient supply, the UK could also see new crop types, or increased yields of crops such as wheat or sugar beet. For some areas of the UK, climate change could also offer wider opportunities for tourism. And for wildlife warmer temperatures could increase survival rates for offspring born in winter.

As with climate predictions, there are still many uncertainties over the extent and distribution of climate impacts. Model predictions are based on a number of assumptions about factors ranging from future rates of warming and economic growth to the technological and social achievability of different levels of emissions cuts. Regional impacts are particularly difficult to predict, though some work has been done to map the risks in different areas of the UK. For example, see this map (p329).

Climate policy to cut global greenhouse gas emissions could have a tangible effect on future climate impacts, not only offering governments a way to avoid the most extreme impacts, but also providing them with more time to prepare and adapt to those that are unavoidable.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,Extreme weather and climate change: is there a link?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Shifts in the number, severity and location of extreme weather events are among the most important impacts of climate change. Basic physics suggest that global warming should affect the occurrence of extreme weather. More energy is being added to the atmosphere, and as it warms, it can hold more water vapour. On this basis alone, cold weather events should decline, heatwaves should increase, and there should be changes in the intensity and frequency of the dry and wet periods that cause droughts and floods.

However, the Earth's climate system is very complex and natural variability, including El Niño and La Niña events, as well as important local and regional variations, make it difficult to separate out human influence on extreme weather events from other factors. In addition, extreme weather is, by definition, relatively rare and it can take a long time to identify statistically significant trends from small datasets.

It is not possible to attribute individual weather events to climate change but a recent review by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of scientific research on extreme weather concluded that there is already strong evidence that the number of extreme cold days around the world is decreasing, while hot days are on the rise, and patterns of rainfall in many regions are being altered as well. Global sea level is also rising by more than 3mm per year, which means surges that are generated by storms over large bodies of water are also becoming higher. Surges are created ahead of storms by the impact of winds on the surface of the water.

There is still uncertainty about the extent to which climate change may already be affecting some other types of extreme weather events, such as tropical cyclones and tornadoes.

How much human populations are affected by changes in extreme weather also depends on whether they are exposed, by living in high-risk areas such as low-lying coastal areas, and vulnerable, due to, for example, poor quality housing. Worldwide, the number of reported deaths from weather-related events has decreased over the past 100 years due to increased efforts to reduce vulnerability and exposure. However, extreme weather can still kill large numbers of people, particularly in poor countries. There were up to 138,000 deaths when Cyclone Nargis hit Myanmar in 2008, for example. In total, more than 200 million people globally are killed or affected by weather-related events on average each year.

Damage and losses from weather-related events have increased markedly over the past 30 years, mostly due to an increase in the number and value of homes and businesses that are exposed to severe weather. This has meant a big increase in insurance claims in many countries. About $150bn in economic losses worldwide were caused by weather-related events in 2012, according to the company Munich Re.

In the UK, the main ways in which climate change may already be affecting extreme weather are through the occurrence of very wet periods, leading to river and flash floods, and sea level rise, increasing the risk of coastal flooding. Four of the five wettest years in the UK since records began in 1910 have occurred since 2000, and preliminary research by the Met Office indicates that the number of extremely wet days is increasing.

The government's Climate Change Risk Assessment, published in 2012, identified a number of potentially serious impacts due to more extreme weather, particularly flooding. In 2012, the second wettest year on record in the UK, insurers paid out £1.19bn to households, businesses and motorists that were affected by storms and floods. An increase in the number of homes and businesses that are at risk of flooding has created a crisis for the insurance industry, which is planning to launch a new scheme to offer cover to those most likely to be affected.

Most of the efforts in the UK and elsewhere to adapt to the impacts of climate change mean making society more resilient to current and future extreme weather. Poor people in developing countries remain particularly vulnerable but even rich countries have trouble protecting themselves against extreme weather, as Hurricane Katrina demonstrated when it flooded New Orleans in 2005.

If global warming of more than 2°C is not avoided through reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, impacts from extreme weather could overwhelm the capacity of some countries to cope, leading to wider impacts, from large-scale migration of populations to an increased risk of conflict.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What is climate finance and where will it come from?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Climate finance involves flows of funds from developed to developing nations to help poorer countries to cut their emissions and adapt to climate change. The sources and governance of climate finance has been widely debated since the 2009 climate change summit in Copenhagen, where industrialised countries committed to giving $100 billion a year in additional climate finance from 2020 onwards. To get things going, immediate 'fast-start' finance of up to $30 billion was promised until the end of 2012.

Donor countries have met their initial commitment on fast-start finance. Over $30 billion in additional climate finance has been provided since Copenhagen. The UK has contributed £1.5 billion ($2.4 billion) so far, rising to £2.9 billion by 2015. But globally there is no clear path to ramp up support to the target $100 billion by the end of the decade – which is a concern given that rich countries have a history of not living up to aid promises.

Anothe concern is that meeting the target so far has involved the reclassification of some existing aid flows. Classification will always be a problem, particularly when it comes to dealing with the impacts of climate change ('adaptation'). Better education and healthcare, access to safe drinking water, improved disaster relief and the availability of micro-finance will all make countries more resilient to climate change, but they are also basic development objectives. Therefore if the aim is climate-resilient development, there is no clear delineation between adaptation assistance and development aid.

Climate finance has been a central element of the international climate change agreements from the outset. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, agreed in 1992, stated that developed countries shall provide ""new and additional financial resources"" to developing countries. In the early years this financial assistance was channelled through the Global Environment Facility (GEF), either directly or through dedicated funds which the GEF administers (in particular, the Least Developed Country Fund and the Special Climate Change Fund). But over the years developing countries have become critical of the GEF, which they see as dominated by developed countries.

The search for new institutional arrangements has therefore been an important aspect of the climate finance discussion. The outcome has been the creation of a new organisation, the Green Climate Fund (GCF), which will be the main channel through which climate finance is allocated. The GCF, which is head-quartered in South Korea, is controlled by a Board on which developed and developing countries are equally represented. There has also been a push for more direct access to funding. Developing countries are keen to get financing without going through international institutions like the World Bank and being subjected to their rules and conditions. Many are setting up special national funds to secure direct access. Others look to the Norway-sponsored Amazon Fund as a potential model.

The process of creating new institutions and establishing a track record of financial probity is inevitably slow. In the meantime the climate finance landscape is dominated by bilateral aid agencies and international development institutions, which implement GEF projects and have set up their own climate finance initiatives. The most notable of them are the World Bank-led Climate Investment Funds.

The Adaptation Fund, which is financed through a levy on international carbon market transactions, is the only international climate fund besides the GCF that is independent of development finance institutions. However, the Adaptation Fund has seen its revenues drop when the international carbon price collapsed, demonstrating that government pledges aren't the only sources of finance that can prove unreliable.

In 2010, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon established a high-level advisory group and tasked it to find the best sources of climate finance. The group concluded that a combination of sources was needed, including aid-style government pledges, market levies and possible new sources such as a tax on international aviation and shipping, which would begin to regulate this so-far uncapped source of emissions, or a financial transaction tax, a policy that has been much-debated in Europe as a way to increase financial stability. A large share of income would also have to come from the private sector through mechanisms like carbon trading.

Little tangible progress has been made on the additional sources of finance since the high-level advisory group has reported. In the meantime, developing countries have started to spend their own funds, particularly on adaptation, and the private sector continues to invest in low-carbon technologies like renewable energy. The UNFCCC debate is only the tip of the climate finance iceberg.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What is the state of international climate talks?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Despite near collapse at each of the last four annual conferences of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the international negotiations always pull back from the brink. Why? Because no country is willing to abandon the goal of an international regime which will effectively combat dangerous climate change. So the search for an international agreement continues.

The negotiations tackle four principal issues: legal form, ambition, assistance to developing countries, and rules and institutions.

On legal form, the 2011 conference achieved an unexpected breakthrough, subsequently cemented at the 2012 conference in Doha. It was agreed to begin a new round of negotiations towards a new ""protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force"", to be concluded by 2015 and to take effect after 2020. At the same time the Kyoto protocol, thought by some to be on the verge of collapse, was kept alive until at least 2020. This was remarkable because the goal of a new internationally legally binding agreement had been specifically rejected at the 2009 conference in Copenhagen, in an effective deal between the US and the ""Basic"" group of emerging economies (China, India, Brazil and South Africa). This goal has not only now been accepted but explicitly made ""applicable to all countries"", which is widely understood to mean that developing as well as developed countries should in future take on binding commitments. This overcomes the principal objection which the US always had to the Kyoto protocol – that it didn't apply to the major emerging countries such as China. There remains huge contention over the precise nature of 'an agreed outcome with legal force', but the 2015 conference (likely to take place in Paris) is now the key negotiating deadline.

The most important element of those negotiations will be on ambition – the goals the international community sets to reduce emissions. At present the sum of country commitments falls far short of the UN's own agreed goal to limit global warming to a maximum of 2C above pre-industrial times. At the 2011 conference it was agreed that this 'emissions gap' must be closed but in present economic circumstances few nations look willing to make stronger commitments, at least before 2020. Much will depend on whether countries' experience of implementing low-carbon measures gives them greater confidence in the possibility of further reductions in the future. The problem of equity remains a major obstacle: developing countries ask why they should do more if the richest countries – particularly the US – do not do enough. It remains to be seen whether sufficient pressure can be applied by the poorest and most climate-vulnerable countries, and by domestic and international civil society, to change the major emitting countries' commitments.

On financial assistance to developing countries, both for adaptation to the effects of climate change, and to help them mitigate their emissions, negotiations have effectively stalled. In Copenhagen developed countries committed to providing $100bn by 2020. But there is dispute over how much of this must be public finance and how much can be private; and whether the public money will be 'additional' to existing aid commitments. Moreover few developed countries have yet said what they will provide in the much shorter term of 2013. In the present economic climate the likelihood is that assistance levels will fall, which will increase anger among developing countries and induce further accusations of broken pledges.

On technology, the goal of developing countries has long been the free or cut-price transfer of low-carbon technologies from developed countries, including the intellectual property rights which would allow domestic manufacture. But this has always been rejected by developed countries, concerned to protect their trading advantages. Negotiations are now focused on more limited goals of co-operation on technology development and deployment.

Negotiations also continue on a number of new institutions and rules, most of which were agreed in outline at the 2010 conference in Cancun but which still require more detailed design. The most important of these include the governance and operation of the Green Climate Fund, which will provide a channel for financial assistance to developing countries; the rules on how emissions from land use change and forestry should be counted; and new mechanisms to support adaptation and to prevent the loss and degradation of forests.

Perhaps the most intriguing feature of the negotiations is the shifting alliances and positions of different countries. Traditionally, negotiations were conducted with developed ('Annex 1') and developing countries ('Non-Annex 1') on opposing sides. At Copenhagen and Cancun a fissure opened up among developing countries, with the emergence of the Basic grouping and increasingly open divergence of interest between them and the poorest and most vulnerable nations. At the Durban conference, the final outcome owed much to a new coalition between the EU, the least developed countries and the Alliance of Small Island States, and a new grouping of Latin American and Caribbean countries with strong commitments to climate action. Its success caused further rifts within the Basic group, with India attempting to hold out against the legal goal but in the end not being supported by China, Brazil or South Africa. As negotiations start in earnest at the December 2013 conference in Poland, much will depend on how these shifting alliances develop over the next few years. With civil society now gearing up for a major new campaigning push, it is possible that Paris in 2015 could achieve what Copenhagen in 2009 could not.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,Carbon tax v cap-and-trade: which is better?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Economists argue that, if the market is left to operate freely, greenhouse gas emissions will be excessive, since there is insufficient incentive for firms and households to reduce emissions. As such, they recommend applying the polluter pays principle and placing a price on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. This can be implemented either through a carbon tax (known as a price instrument) or a cap-and-trade scheme (a so-called quantity instrument).

A carbon tax imposes a tax on each unit of greenhouse gas emissions and gives firms (and households, depending on the scope) an incentive to reduce pollution whenever doing so would cost less than paying the tax. As such, the quantity of pollution reduced depends on the chosen level of the tax. The tax is set by assessing the cost or damage associated with each unit of pollution and the costs associated with controlling that pollution. Getting the tax level right is key: too low and firms and households are likely to opt for paying the tax and continuing to pollute, over and above what is optimal for society. Too high and the costs will rise higher than necessary to reduce emissions, impacting on profits, jobs and end consumers.

By contrast, a cap-and-trade system sets a maximum level of pollution, a cap, and distributes emissions permits among firms that produce emissions. Companies must have a permit to cover each unit of pollution they produce, and they can obtain these permits either through an initial allocation or auction, or through trading with other firms. Since some firms inevitably find it easier or cheaper to reduce pollution than others, trading takes place. Whilst the maximum pollution quantity is set in advance, the trading price of permits fluctuates, becoming more expensive when demand is high relative to supply (for example when the economy is growing) and cheaper when demand is lower (for example in a recession). A price on pollution is therefore created as a result of setting a ceiling on the overall quantity of emissions.

In certain idealized circumstances, carbon taxes and cap-and-trade have exactly the same outcomes, since they are both ways to price carbon. However, in reality they differ in many ways.

One difference is the way the two policies distribute the cost of reducing pollution. With cap-and-trade, it has often been the case that permits are given out for free initially (known as ""grandfathering""). This means cheaper compliance for industry in the early stages of the scheme, because they only pay for any extra permits bought from other firms – not for the initial tranche of permits given to them to cover most of their emissions under 'business as usual'. This approach is obviously popular with industry and explains why grandfathering has been used, since it helps get firms to accept controls on emissions in the first place. By contrast, with a tax there is an immediate cost for businesses to pay on every unit of greenhouse gas produced, so there is a bigger initial hit to the balance sheet. But while grandfathering is better for near-term business profitability, it is not necessarily the best outcome for society. Indeed, it deprives the government of valuable revenues, which it could raise in auctioning the permits initially, and which could be used to reduce other taxes.

The mechanisms also differ in how they perform under uncertainty about the costs and benefits of reducing emissions. Under a tax, the price of emitting a unit of pollution is set, but the total quantity of emissions is not. Therefore a tax ensures everyone knows the price being paid (at least for the immediate future) for each unit of carbon dioxide emitted, but uncertainty remains about the actual quantity of emissions. Conversely, cap-and-trade provides certainty about the quantity of emissions (it cannot exceed the cap), but uncertainty about the cost of achieving these reductions. Which is preferred depends on how sensitive the level of environmental damage is to changes in emissions, compared with how sensitive the cost of reducing pollution is to the same changes. If the level of environmental damage is more sensitive, then it is important to be sure what the quantity of emissions is, which points to cap-and-trade. Conversely if the cost of reducing pollution is more highly sensitive to changes in emissions, it is better to be sure about the cost of cutting emissions, pointing to a tax.

What this means for climate change policy is debated. In the short term, most economists agree that uncertainty alone argues for a tax. Climate change depends on the stock of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and in each year the increase in that stock due to new emissions is small, so the environment is probably not that sensitive to the uncertainty about the level of emissions brought about by choosing a tax, at least over a year or two. On the other side of the ledger, the cost of reducing pollution is highly sensitive to changes in emissions, since it can be expensive to businesses to change their production methods abruptly. In the long term, however, it is less clear whether a tax is preferable, because big changes in the stock of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may cause substantial environmental damage.

Some economists recommend a hybrid model that may offer the best of both worlds. This tends to comprise of a cap on emissions (to regulate the quantity of pollution), but with adjustment mechanisms such as a carbon price floor or ceiling, to keep the price of a permit within acceptable bounds. Hybrid schemes have their own problems, however, such as greater complexity and more intervention by the regulator in the permit market.

Whichever of these policies is favoured to place a price on carbon, they represent just one of a number of policies needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,Is nuclear power necessary for solving climate change?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"The relative costs and benefits of nuclear energy have been the subject of heated debate in recent years thanks to a combination of factors, including the need to cut carbon emissions and the 2011 accident at Fukushima, Japan. Critics argue that nuclear is not only dangerous but also unnecessary for tackling climate change; supporters claim the risks are small and that abandoning nuclear would make an already huge challenge even harder and more expensive.

One thing that's clear is that decarbonising electric power will be critical for solving climate change. Even assuming big gains in efficiency, the world will need about twice as much electricity in 2050 as it does today. The problem is that, as of today, most of the world's electricity comes from coal (40%) and gas (20%), with hydroelectric (16%) and nuclear (13%) by far the largest low-carbon sources. In Europe most of the new generating capacity being added today is low-carbon wind. In China, the world's largest energy consumer, most of the new capacity is coal, although it is also the world's largest investor in both wind and nuclear. Worldwide, the majority of new capacity is still coal or gas.

This situation needs to be turned around radically and urgently if we are to meet the objective that world leaders set in Copenhagen in 2009 of limiting the average increase in global temperatures to 2C. By then, the great majority of the world's energy will need to come from low-carbon sources. In developed countries, such as the UK, virtually all of it. 2050 may seem a long way away until you remember that a new coal or nuclear power station being planned today will probably still be operating then.

The main low-carbon options for the coming years and decades, in no particular order, are hydro, wind, nuclear, biofuels, solar power and coal and gas burned in plants that can capture and store the carbon emissions (CCS). The availability of hydro, wind and solar depends, to varying degrees, on local conditions. Wind and solar are intermittent and cannot provide 'baseload' power (a drawback that can be mitigated to some degree, at a cost, by large connecting power networks or large-scale energy storage). Biofuels depend on the availability of plant materials. For these reasons a mixture of sources will be needed and the optimum choices will be different in different parts of the world. CCS is the only low-carbon option other than nuclear that can provide baseload power in regions where hydro or large-scale biofuel materials are not available. To that extent, particularly in the UK, where we know that we have suitable natural storage reservoirs, CCS provides a possible alternative to nuclear if it can be successfully demonstrated.

There is a lot of uncertainty about the cost of nuclear power compared to the alternatives. A recent UK study estimated the cost of nuclear as falling somewhere above 'low cost' options such as onshore wind, mini-hydro and some biofuels, but below 'expensive' options such as offshore wind and CCS. Early stage technologies such as wave are estimated as having still higher costs. The report suggests that the uncertainties are considerable and that these increase as one looks towards the future. Comparatively, solar power is expensive today but its cost has been declining sharply and it could emerge as a highly competitive option, especially in sunny parts of the world. CCS is a technical possibility but it is hard to know what it will cost until it has been demonstrated.

Following the Fukushima accident, most of the developing countries with plans for new nuclear stations, and many of the developed countries, are expected to press ahead, though with some delay for safety reviews. However, Germany, where 23% of electricity was nuclear, has decided to phase out nuclear power entirely by 2020 while also seeking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 40% below 1990 levels. The jury is still out on how successful this will be. Germany can be expected to pioneer the way towards much heavier reliance on renewables but some analysts are concerned about the cost and the possible need for additional gas or even coal plants.

Not surprisingly, energy modellers do not all agree on which low-carbon energy technologies will be needed most in 2050. Amongst the better known commentators, the International Energy Agency project a nuclear share of 20%, while the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis similarly predict a significant share for nuclear in two of their three headline scenarios, but also offer a scenario in which nuclear has been phased out.

All in all, there is no simple answer to this question. If you believe strongly enough that we should phase out nuclear then with sufficiently strong political commitment around the world, this could be done consistently with tackling climate change. However, as a practical matter, we are far from being on course to limit carbon emissions to levels consistent with a 2C target. Ruling out one of the major low-carbon technology options currently available is bound to add to the difficulty and the risk of what is already looking like a very tough challenge. Balancing the problems of nuclear power against its contribution to climate mitigation (and other energy policy objectives) is an inescapable dilemma.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,How will climate change impact on fresh water security?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Fresh water is crucial to human society – not just for drinking, but also for farming, washing and many other activities. It is expected to become increasingly scarce in the future, and this is partly due to climate change.

Understanding the problem of fresh water scarcity begins by considering the distribution of water on the planet. Approximately 98% of our water is salty and only 2% is fresh. Of that 2%, almost 70% is snow and ice, 30% is groundwater, less than 0.5% is surface water (lakes, rivers, etc) and less than 0.05% is in the atmosphere. Climate change has several effects on these proportions on a global scale. The main one is that warming causes polar ice to melt into the sea, which turns fresh water into sea water, although this has little direct effect on water supply.

Another effect of warming is to increase the amount of water that the atmosphere can hold, which in turn can lead to more and heavier rainfall when the air cools. Although more rainfall can add to fresh water resources, heavier rainfall leads to more rapid movement of water from the atmosphere back to the oceans, reducing our ability to store and use it. Warmer air also means that snowfall is replaced by rainfall and evaporation rates tend to increase. Yet another impact of higher temperatures is the melting of inland glaciers. This will increase water supply to rivers and lakes in the short to medium term, but this will cease once these glaciers have melted. In the sub-tropics, climate change is likely to lead to reduced rainfall in what are already dry regions. The overall effect is an intensification of the water cycle that causes more extreme floods and droughts globally.

When planning future water supplies, however, the global picture is less important than the effect of warming on fresh water availability in individual regions and in individual seasons. This is a much more complicated thing to predict than global trends. The IPCC technical report on climate change and water concludes that, despite global increases in rainfall, many dry regions including the Mediterranean and southern Africa will suffer badly from reduced rainfall and increased evaporation. As a result, the IPCC special report on climate change adaptation estimates that around one billion people in dry regions may face increasing water scarcity.

However, the degree to which this will happen cannot be predicted with confidence by current models. In many regions different models cannot even agree on whether the climate will become wetter or drier. For example, a recent study of future flows in the River Thames at Kingston shows a possible 11% increase over the next 80 years relative to the last 60 years. However, under an identical emissions scenario, the same report shows an alternative projection of a 7% decrease in flows.

Especially little is known about future declines in regional groundwater resources because of lack of research on this topic, even though around 50% of global domestic water supply comes from groundwater. Although scientists are making progress in reducing uncertainty about fresh water scarcity, these kinds of unknowns mean that water supply strategies must be adaptable so that they can be effective under different scenarios.

The direct impact of climate change is not the only reason to be concerned about future fresh water scarcity – a fact highlighted by a recent United Nations Environment Programme report. The increasing global population means more demand for agriculture, greater use of water for irrigation and more water pollution. In parallel, rising affluence in some countries means a larger number of people living water-intensive lifestyles, including watering of gardens, cleaning cars and using washing machines and dishwashers. Rapidly developing economies also result in more industry and in many cases this comes without modern technology for water saving and pollution control. Therefore concerns about climate change must be viewed alongside management of pollution and demand for water.

The most common solution to increasing demand, and a way of insuring against possible climate change impacts, is the engineered redistribution of freshwater over space and time: reservoirs to store it, pipelines to transfer it, and desalination to recover freshwater from the oceans. Efforts are also being made to increase water saving, reuse and recycling, and in the UK there is currently major investment into education and water-saving technology by the government and water industry.

Continued investment in education and research will be essential to providing the knowledge, skills and technology needed to combat fresh water scarcity in the future.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What's Redd and will it help tackle climate change?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Forests and trees store carbon. When they're burnt down or cleared – a process referred to as deforestation – this stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide and contributes to climate change.

Tropical deforestation contributes about 12% of the carbon dioxide emissions caused by human activity. This figure rises to 15% if you include tropical peatlands, which are also currently being degraded on a huge scale, and which can contain up to ten times more carbon than forests. In the last decade, the largest amounts of deforestation occurred across the humid tropics. Whilst it can be difficult to measure, current global estimates suggest about 13m hectares (an area more half the size of the UK) were lost annually between 2000 and 2010. Causes of deforestation range from populations clearing land to feed their families to agribusinesses clearing huge tracts of forest to make way for monoculture farms producing high-value commodities like palm oil and soya.

Scientists have recognised the value of protecting forests in tackling climate change. In response, policymakers have developed a family of policies – collectively known as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (Redd) – to provide a financial incentive to governments, agribusinesses and communities to maintain rather than reduce forest cover. These policies could not only cut carbon emissions but also – given that tropical forests are the most species-rich terrestrial habitat – offer benefits in terms of biodiversity conservation. Where local people are properly involved in the Redd process it may also help alleviate rural poverty. More recently, Redd has evolved to incorporate wider benefits beyond reducing deforestation and degradation alone. The expanded scope, referred to as Redd+, includes moves to manage forests more sustainably and ensure greater conservation efforts.

Redd policies operate through a variety of mechanisms, including those administered by the United Nations (UN-REDD) and the World Bank. Redd finance is also considered in the international climate change negotiations and remains a key component of international climate finance discussions. Under Redd, payments for forest protection are made by developed countries to developing countries, tied to performance in deforestation reduction.

While experts have demonstrated how Redd could significantly reduce CO2 emissions, and stem biodiversity loss, it is not without its problems. Some question the fairness of a scheme which focuses on reducing emissions caused by some of the world's poorest people while emissions continue to rise in richer countries. Some developing countries may be wary of foreign interference in their land use policies. Researchers also highlight operational concerns – such as the difficulty in monitoring and measuring deforestation rates, or attributing changes in deforestation to Redd finance. Many tropical forest countries lack the capabilities to address these challenges. Consequently, capacity building is an important component of Redd.

Redd finance to developing countries is still fairly limited in scale. As an example of what might be required, the 2008 Eliasch Review written for the UK government estimated that some $17–32bn would be needed annually to address tropical deforestation across the world. Current funding remains far off this mark, with Norway alone currently providing 67% of the total, having pledged $1bn for projects in Indonesia over seven years. With limited funds available, it can be difficult to protect forests, as alternative land uses (such as forest clearance for palm oil) can offer more immediate and guaranteed cash returns. Consequently, many experts have called for a scaling-up of Redd commitments and finance flows – though some have argued that even if large-scale Redd+ finance does materialise it may still struggle to compete with other land uses, especially as commodity prices continue to rise.

Whatever becomes of Redd in the future, experts agree it should focus first on areas that can most efficiently provide CO2 reductions (such as tropical peat swamp forests) while also offering the potential for biodiversity conservation and poverty alleviation.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,To what extent could planting trees help solve climate change?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Forests play an important an important role in climate change. The destruction and degradation of forests contributes to the problem through the release of CO2. But the planting of new forests can help mitigate against climate change by removing CO2 from the atmosphere. Combined with the sun's energy, the captured carbon is converted into trunks, branches, roots and leaves via the process of photosynthesis. It is stored in this ""biomass"" until being returned back into the atmosphere, whether through natural processes or human interference, thus completing the carbon cycle.

Tree planting and plantation forestry are well established both in the private and public sectors. The most recent data released by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation suggest that plantation forests comprised an estimated 7% of global forest area in 2010. Most of these forests were established in areas that were previously not under forest cover, at least in recent years. Trees are also planted as part of efforts to restore natural forests as well as in agroforestry, which involves increasing tree cover on agricultural land and pastures.

Under certain conditions plantations can grow relatively fast, thus absorbing CO2 at higher rates than natural forests. In the absence of major disturbances, newly planted or regenerating forests can continue to absorb carbon for 20–50 years or more. In comparison to preventing the loss of natural forests, however, tree planting has the potential to make only a limited contribution to reducing CO2 levels in the atmosphere. In 2000, the IPCC gathered the available evidence for a special report which concluded that tree-planting could sequester (remove from the atmosphere) around 1.1–1.6 GT of CO2 per year. That compares to total global greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 50 GT of CO2 in 2004.

Unlike measures to reduce deforestation, tree planting and reforestation were included as activities eligible for finance under the Kyoto protocol. Kyoto's rules and procedures, however, restricted the scale and scope of these activities. As a result, projects have struggled to get off the ground and the carbon sequestered has been almost negligible. Outside of Kyoto, some tree-planting projects established to absorb CO2 have turned out to be nonviable due to the cost of acquiring inputs or protecting young trees from fire, drought, pests or diseases. The cost of land is another barrier to widespread tree-planting, especially where there is competition with other land uses such as food or biofuel production.

As negotiations over the future of Kyoto continue, the extent of the possible role of tree planting in a future climate change framework remains unclear. Tree planting is, however, unlikely to be implemented on a scale to reach even the relatively modest potential contribution outlined by the IPPC – especially in the absence of a high carbon price.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,Will climate change lead to more droughts?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Although climate change is expected to lead to slightly more rainfall at the global level, the timing and distribution of that rain is likely to change, increasing the chance of drought in some regions. The details are very difficult to predict, however. This is partly because regional climate impacts are strongly dependent on large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns like the jet stream, which are hard to model in climate simulations. There is some indication from climate modelling that the Mediterranean, central America and Western Australia regions may experience reduced precipitation, but there is still considerable uncertainty as climate models do not all agree, because local features such as mountains and rainforests can be important, and because of the large range of natural variability.

The picture is made even more complex by the fact that unusually low levels of rainfall (so-called meteorological drought) isn't the only factor affecting the existence or significance of drought conditions. Just as important is hydrological drought, in which the water supplies in groundwater or reservoirs are depleted. There are also ""agricultural drought"" and ""economic drought"" which result from the inability to access water when needed rather than from the lack of water itself, and in some regions these are more important than the physical factors.

The various types of drought are closely related, of course, and different countries have different levels of sensitivity to each. Meteorological drought was experienced by southern parts of the UK in 2011, leading to hydrological drought as the water in storage systems became low. When the rainfall increased again in spring 2012, hydrological drought conditions (and the hosepipe ban) remained in place until the stores started to be recharged. In that case the effect on the population was limited, but in places like India, where the year's rainfall is concentrated in the monsoon season, small changes in the location or timing of precipitation can have a big regional impact on agriculture.

Like other types of extreme weather, drought is experienced when circulation patterns get 'stuck' in one formation, or push outside their normal bounds of variation. In 2003, the heatwave and drought in Europe was caused by just such a blocked circulation pattern and may have caused tens of thousands of excess deaths. As temperatures remained high for a long time, the soil moisture evaporated, causing an additional feedback and worsening the heatwave. Calculations indicate that this kind of event may have doubled in frequency due to greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and could continue to become more frequent and more severe. Therefore, if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase, then by the end of this century European summers like 2003 could be ""anomalously cold"".

The exact position and timing of monsoons are influenced by many factors and would vary from year to year even in the absence of global warming. Climate change is expected to cause a weakening of the circulation pattern, but an increase in atmospheric water content. Some areas are predicted to experience more drought, others less, but the competing effects make it harder to detect and predict changes, so uncertainty in these projections is large.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What's the 'hydrogen economy'?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"The term ""hydrogen economy"" refers to the vision of using hydrogen as a low-carbon energy source – replacing, for example, gasoline as a transport fuel or natural gas as a heating fuel. Hydrogen is attractive because whether it is burned to produce heat or reacted with air in a fuel cell to produce electricity, the only byproduct is water.

Hydrogen is not found in pure form on Earth, however, so it must be produced from other compounds such as natural gas, biomass, alcohols or water. In all cases it takes energy to convert these into pure hydrogen. For that reason, hydrogen is really an energy carrier or storage medium rather than an energy source in itself – and the climate change impact of using it depends on the carbon footprint of the energy used to produce it.

One of the most potentially useful ways to use hydrogen is in electric cars or buses in conjunction with a fuel cell which converts the hydrogen into electricity. Fuel cells are attractive because they're far more efficient than the internal combustion engines they can replace – though the latter can still be used with hydrogen fuels if desired.

At the moment, hydrogen is most commonly produced from natural gas. In this situation, a typical fuel cell car generates 70–80g CO2 for each kilometre driven – similar to a modern gasoline hybrid or to a battery electric vehicle charged with today's UK grid electricity. These emissions can be reduced towards zero if the hydrogen is produced using low-carbon electricity sources such as renewables, nuclear or CCS to electrolyse water. The downside is that in this situation only around half as much electricity comes out of the fuel cell as was put in to produce the hydrogen in the first place. The rest is lost as heat.

Partly for this reason, and partly due to concerns over the commercial readiness of hydrogen fuel cell cars, battery-based electric cars have received more attention in recent years than hydrogen cars. However, hydrogen vehicles retain a number of important advantages: they can be rapidly refuelled in just a couple of minutes and have a range of many hundreds of kilometres. So the best technology depends on the final cost, carbon mitigation potential, and consumer needs in each case.

In addition to transport, hydrogen may also be useful as a way to store renewable energy from intermittent sources – for example, when the wind is blowing but there is not high demand for electricity. In this context, it's an alternative to large-scale batteries or other storage systems. Another possibility is to use hydrogen as a heating fuel in our homes and buildings, either blended with natural gas or neat.

It is the flexibility that hydrogen offers that makes it so potentially useful within future low-carbon energy systems. It can be produced from a wide variety of resources and can be used in a wide range of applications, such as power generation, as a transport fuel for low carbon vehicles, for the chemical industry, and for low carbon heating. Moreover, hydrogen is already used extensively in the chemical industry so industry is familiar with its production, handling and distribution on a large scale. For all these reasons, many experts see hydrogen as a key enabler of the lowest-cost low-carbon energy system.

While hydrogen can help to decarbonise our energy system, however, it is important to be specific about where and when hydrogen can help. In that sense, it might be better to think about 'hydrogen in the economy' rather than 'a hydrogen economy' as such.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,Will climate change lead to more flooding?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Because warmer air can hold more water, climate change will give the potential for stronger rainfall events. What this means for the risk of flooding, however, will vary widely from location to location depending on local climatic changes that at present are difficult to predict with confidence.

Floods can be caused either by an excess of rainfall leading to greater surface runoff or by storm surges raising the sea level. (The UK Environment Agency provides a map showing the local risk from both river and coastal flooding.) Human activity can increase the risks, for example by paving over areas which were previously covered by vegetation, reducing the capacity of the land to absorb rainfall and causing it to run off more quickly. Planning decisions – such whether to build houses in flood plains or position caravans next to the sea – can also affect society's vulnerability to floods.

Extreme weather events are usually associated with unusual (""anomalous"") atmospheric circulation patterns. In normal conditions, circulation patterns vary over time and bring with them different kinds of weather. For example, the jet stream in the North Atlantic brings storms and wet weather to the UK; when it is pointing away from the county the result is more settled and drier conditions. Excess rainfall is caused when the atmosphere becomes ""stuck"" in one pattern of circulation, giving wet weather for an extended period in some regions. In this situation, soils and groundwater reservoirs can become saturated, which can leads to flooding as additional rain runs off the land surface. Floods in Pakistan in 2010, for example, were caused by an unusual pattern of atmospheric circulation which also contributed to the heatwave and fires in Russia in the same year.

How will climate change affect these factors? There will be the potential for the atmosphere to hold more water, but climate change may also result in changes to large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns like the jet stream, which are harder for climate simulations to predict. Recent results with state-of-the-art climate models have raised the possibility that climate change may affect the jet stream more than scientists previously expected, making floods in the UK more likely. However, the uncertainty in these projections remains large. Flash flooding could also become more frequent as extreme rainfall events are consistently predicted to become more severe.

The risk of coastal flooding is influenced by the frequency and intensity of storms, and by the local sea level. Although in most areas it is not possible to predict the effect of climate change on storms with certainty, we can say with confidence that the sea level is rising and this will increase the risk of coastal flooding in many areas. However, the rate of sea level rise is dependent on location, and the absolute amount is, again, highly uncertain.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,Onshore wind energy: what are the pros and cons?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Wind turbines harness the energy of moving air to generate electricity. Onshore wind refers to turbines located on land, while offshore turbines are located out at sea or in freshwater. In the UK, the pros and cons of onshore wind energy, in comparison with other low-carbon and fossil fuel energy sources, have recently been the subject of debate in the press and among politicians.

Onshore wind already plays a leading role in the generation of renewable electricity in the UK. In 2010, it generated around 7TWh – more than a quarter of the electricity provided by British renewables at that time and enough to save six million tonnes of CO2, according to government estimates. By 2020, onshore wind is expected to generate up to 30TWh. Onshore wind can therefore play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions created by the UK's power sector – which will be crucial to meeting the UK's legally binding carbon budgets.

Onshore wind has the advantage of being one of the most affordable renewable energy sources. Generating electricity from onshore wind turbines typically costs around 7–9p per kWh, which is around half the cost of offshore wind and a quarter of the costs of solar photovoltaic panels. It is also slightly cheaper, on average, than nuclear power. Onshore wind generation is still slightly more expensive than fossil fuels (generating electricity from gas power plants currently costs between 4.1 and 7.5 p/kWh), but its price is expected to fall in the coming years.

Some emissions are created by the manufacture, transportation and installation of wind turbines, but these are considered fairly low. Additional emissions are attributed to the fact that wind energy (like solar and wave power) is intermittent, generating electricity only when the wind is blowing, and at sufficient strength. When wind strength is insufficient for turbines to operate, fossil-fuel-based power supply is needed as ""backup"". The current small proportion of renewable electricity in the UK market requires very little backup, but as the share increases additional backup will be needed. However, other technologies, such as inter-linkages with other countries' grids, energy storage and electricity demand management, are expected to help tackle intermittency in the future, so the overall future impact on emissions is considered relatively low.

Onshore wind has been criticised for its visual impact. Although other power infrastructure, like fossil fuel and nuclear power stations, can also modify landscapes and habitats, onshore wind turbines are typically more spread out than other large-scale energy infrastructure projects and so can affect a larger area. Another criticism is that species such as birds and bats may also be affected by wind turbines – though bird fatalities due to turbine collisions are relatively low compared to other fatality causes, such as traffic and domestic cats. Impacts on wildlife can be minimised by careful site selection and by avoiding areas of high conservation or habitat value. A third potential issue is that turbines can contribute to noise pollution, but government studies find noise levels are comparatively low and should not significantly impact on nearby residents. New guidance is being drafted to inform future planning policy on noise issues.

Environmental Impact Assessments review these kinds of potential impacts on a case-by-case basis and seek to protect unsuitable areas, such as those of high conservation or heritage value. In some cases, undesirable local impacts may make more expensive renewable technologies, such as offshore wind or solar, more attractive. The extra cost of offshore wind can be seen as the premium society is willing to pay in order to avoid the local environmental cost of onshore turbines.

The choice between more affordable electricity (which would favour onshore wind) and local environmental protection (which may favour other low-carbon technologies) is ultimately a societal and political one. Given the economic and environmental trade-offs, technological uncertainty and the absence of one clear winner when it comes to energy sources, many economists suggest (pdf) the best approach is a portfolio of different technologies to balance the cost to consumers and environmental concerns. Onshore wind has a role to play in this energy mix and in helping the UK achieve its emission reduction targets.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,How will climate change affect food production?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Food is one of society's key sensitivities to climate. A year of not enough or too much rainfall, a hot spell or cold snap at the wrong time, or extremes, like flooding and storms, can have a significant effect on local crop yields and livestock production. While modern farming technologies and techniques have helped to reduce this vulnerability and boost production, the impact of recent droughts in the USA, China and Russia on global cereal production highlight a glaring potential future vulnerability.

There is some evidence that climate change is already having a measurable affect on the quality and quantity of food produced globally. But this is small when compared with the significant increase in global food production that has been achieved over the past few decades. Isolating the influence of climatic change from all the other trends is difficult, but one recent Stanford University study found that increases in global production of maize and wheat since 1980 would have been about 5% higher were it not for climate change.

All else being equal, rising carbon dioxide concentrations – the main driver of climate change – could increase production of some crops, such as rice, soybean and wheat. However, the changing climate would affect the length and quality of the growing season and farmers could experience increasing damage to their crops, caused by a rising intensity of droughts, flooding or fires.

The latest IPCC report predicted improving conditions for food production in the mid to high latitudes over the next few decades, including in the northern USA, Canada, northern Europe and Russia. Conversely, parts of the subtropics, such as the Mediterranean region and parts of Australia, and the low latitudes, could experience declining conditions. For example, across Africa, yields from rain-fed agriculture could decline by as much as 50% by 2020. Beyond this, if global temperatures rise by more than about 1–3°C, declining conditions could be experienced over a much larger area.

The future course of global food production will depend on how well societies can adapt to such climatic changes, as well as the influence of other pressures, such as the competition for land from biofuel production. The IPCC concluded that in the poorer, low-latitude countries, climate change could seriously challenge the capacity to adapt for a warming of more than 3°C. The richer, higher latitude countries are likely to have a greater capacity to adapt and exploit changing climatic conditions.

But we can't ignore the potential for ""surprises"" down the line. There are many uncertainties in such predictions. The world has not seen such changes in climate for millennia, and so it is impossible to know how our agricultural systems will react in the real world. For example, the complex interlinkages with the impacts of climate change on pests, diseases and pollinators, like bees, are largely unknown. Also, climate models have difficulty in accurately predicting the detailed local environmental changes that are important for food production, particularly weather extremes.

A looming vulnerability is the world's fisheries, which provide an important source of protein for at least half the world's population. Fisheries are already stressed by overexploitation and pollution. Warming surface waters in the oceans, rivers and lakes, as well as sea level rise and melting ice, will adversely affect many fish species. Some marine fish species are already adapting by migrating to the high latitudes, but others, such as Arctic and freshwater species, have nowhere to go. The absorption of carbon dioxide emissions by the oceans also has a direct impact on marine ecosystems through ocean acidification.

But what does this mean for food security – the price and availability of food for the world's seven billion people? A 2011 Foresight report concluded that climate change is a relatively small factor here, at least in the short term, when compared with the rapid increases in global food demand expected in the next decade. On current projections, by 2050 there will be between one and three billion additional mouths to feed. As people become wealthier, they also demand more food and disproportionally more meat, which requires far more land and water resources per calorie consumed. When these factors are combined, it points toward a future of increasing and more volatile food prices.

As was seen during the 2007–08 food price spikes, the poorest countries and communities will be hit first and hardest. The Foresight report concluded that international policy has an important role to play here – today, despite plentiful supplies of food globally, almost one billion people are undernourished.

Finally, food production itself is a significant emitter of greenhouse gases, as well as a cause of environmental degradation in many parts of the world. Agriculture contributes about 15% of all emissions, on a par with transport. When land conversion and the wider food system are taken into account the total contribution of food may be as high as 30%. This means that to limit the long-run impacts of climate change, food production must become not only more resilient to climate but also more sustainable and low-carbon itself.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What is a carbon price and why do we need one?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"A carbon price is a cost applied to carbon pollution to encourage polluters to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas they emit into the atmosphere. Economists widely agree that introducing a carbon price is the single most effective way for countries to reduce their emissions.

Climate change is considered a market failure by economists, because it imposes huge costs and risks on future generations who will suffer the consequences of climate change, without these costs and risks normally being reflected in market prices. To overcome this market failure, they argue, we need to internalise the costs of future environmental damage by putting a price on the thing that causes it – namely carbon emissions.

A carbon price not only has the effect of encouraging lower-carbon behaviour (eg using a bike rather than driving a car), but also raises money that can be used in part to finance a clean-up of ""dirty"" activities (eg investment in research into fuel cells to help cars pollute less). With a carbon price in place, the costs of stopping climate change are distributed across generations rather than being borne overwhelmingly by future generations.

There are two main ways to establish a carbon price. First, a government can levy a carbon tax on the distribution, sale or use of fossil fuels, based on their carbon content. This has the effect of increasing the cost of those fuels and the goods or services created with them, encouraging business and people to switch to greener production and consumption. Typically the government will decide how to use the revenue, though in one version, the so-called fee-and-dividend model – the tax revenues are distributed in their entirety directly back to the population.

The second approach is a quota system called cap-and-trade. In this model, the total allowable emissions in a country or region are set in advance (""capped""). Permits to pollute are created for the allowable emissions budget and either allocated or auctioned to companies. The companies can trade permits between one another, introducing a market for pollution that should ensure that the carbon savings are made as cheaply as possible.

To serve its purpose, the carbon price set by a tax or cap-and-trade scheme must be sufficiently high to encourage polluters to change behaviour and reduce pollution in accordance with national targets. For example, the UK has a target to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2050, compared with 1990 levels, with various intermediate targets along the way. The government's independent advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, estimates that a carbon price of £30 per tonne of carbon dioxide in 2020 and £70 in 2030 would be required to meet these goals.

Currently, many large UK companies pay a price for the carbon they emit through the EU's emissions trading scheme. However, the price of carbon through the scheme is considered by many economists to be too low to help the UK to meet its targets, so the Treasury plans to make all companies covered by the scheme pay a minimum of £16 per tonne of carbon emitted from April 2013.

Ideally, there should be a uniform carbon price across the world, reflecting the fact that a tonne of carbon dioxide does the same amount of damage over time wherever it is emitted. Uniform pricing would also remove the risk that polluting businesses flee to so-called ""pollution havens""' – countries where a lack of environmental regulation enables them to continue to pollute unrestrained. At the moment, carbon pricing is far from uniform but a growing number of countries and regions have, or plan to have, carbon pricing schemes in place, whether through cap-and-trade or carbon taxes. These include the European Union, Australia, South Korea, South Africa, parts of China and California.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What is the 'polluter pays' principle?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"The 'polluters pays' principle is the commonly accepted practice that those who produce pollution should bear the costs of managing it to prevent damage to human health or the environment. For instance, a factory that produces a potentially poisonous substance as a byproduct of its activities is usually held responsible for its safe disposal.

This principle underpins most of the regulation of pollution affecting land, water and air. Pollution is defined in UK law as contamination of the land, water or air by harmful or potentially harmful substances.
Part of a set of broader principles to guide sustainable development worldwide (formally known as the 1992 Rio Declaration), the polluter pays principle has also been applied more specifically to emissions of greenhouse gases which cause climate change.

Greenhouse gas emissions are considered a form of pollution because they cause potential harm and damage through impacts on the climate. However, in this case, because society has been slow to recognise the link between greenhouse gases and climate change, and because the atmosphere is considered by some to be a 'global commons' (that everyone shares and has a right to use), emitters are generally not held responsible for controlling this form of pollution.

However, it is possible to implement the 'polluter pays' principle through a so-called carbon price. As we'll discuss in future questions in this series, this imposes a charge on the emission of greenhouse gases equivalent to the corresponding potential cost caused through future climate change. In this way, a financial incentive is created for a factory, for instance, to minimise its costs by reducing emissions.

Many economists argue a carbon price should be global and uniform across countries and sectors so that polluters do not simply move operations to so-called 'pollution havens' – countries where a lack of environmental regulation allows them to continue to pollute without restrictions. ",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What's energy efficiency and how much can it help cut emissions?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Energy efficiency means using less energy to provide the same service. For example, a compact fluorescent bulb is more efficient than a traditional incandescent bulb as it uses much less electrical energy to produce the same amount of light. Similarly, an efficient boiler takes less fuel to heat a home to a given temperature than a less efficient model.

The phrase 'energy efficiency' is often used as a shorthand to describe any kind of energy-saving measure, though technically it should be distinguished from energy conservation – a broader term which can also include forgoing a service rather than changing the efficiency with which it is provided. Examples of energy conservation include turning down a thermostat in the winter or walking to the shops rather than driving there.

Increasing energy efficiency often costs money up-front but in many cases this capital outlay will be paid back in the form of reduced energy costs within a short time period. This makes efficiency improvements an attractive starting point for reducing carbon emissions.

The scope of the savings – and the techniques required – depend on the situation and location. For homes in cool countries such as the UK, the most effective measures include increasing insulation, draught proofing, installing good-quality double-glazed windows and switching to more efficient appliances and light bulbs. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) estimates that these improvements could reduce annual CO2 emissions from British homes by around 17 million tonnes by 2020 – around a tenth of the 2008 residential total.

By contrast, increasing efficiency in non-domestic buildings often means focusing on ventilation and air-conditioning, in addition to lighting, heating and appliances. Many such buildings have achieved savings of around 25% after undergoing a refit to increase efficiency.

Energy-intensive industries, such as iron, steel and cement manufacture, have become more efficient over time due to new equipment and better re-use of waste heat. For example, a hot pipe containing a chemical that needs to be cooled can be used to heat up other chemicals (this is known as 'heat integration'). Motors are used widely in industry for a variety of tasks, such as pumping, mixing and driving conveyor belts. The installation of efficient, correctly sized motors and drives can result in energy savings of 20–25%.

Vehicles have also become more energy efficient over the decades thanks to factors such as improved engines and lighter, more aerodynamic designs. The potential exists for further improvements and in EU the emissions of the average new car is set to decrease from 150 to 95 grams of CO2 per km by 2020. The CCC forecasts that the introduction of efficiency improvements to cars, vans and HGVs could reduce CO2 emissions in the UK by 12.3 million tonnes by 2020 – around 10% of total for surface transport in 2008.

Improving energy efficiency does not necessarily translate into reduced CO2 emissions: the savings depend on the situation. If the energy is supplied from fossil fuels – such as petrol in a car or electricity from a coal-fired plant – then improved efficiency will cut emissions. But if the energy is supplied by a low-carbon source such as electricity from nuclear or renewables, then improving efficiency may have little impact on emissions. (When comparing electric and non-electric appliances, it's important to consider the efficiency of the power generation, too: switching from a 90% efficient gas boiler to a '100% efficient' electric heater will increase energy use and emissions if the electricity comes from regular fossil fuel power plants, which themselves are highly inefficient, losing much of the energy in their fuel as waste heat.)

Energy efficiency is always a good idea. Whether it results in energy savings depends on what we do with the money we saved. In some cases, efficiency savings can be offset by changes in user behaviour – the so-called 'rebound effect'. One example would be that insulating a home may make it more economic for the resident to maintain a higher temperature, increasing the standard of comfort but reducing the energy savings.

Nonetheless, improving energy efficiency is a key tool for reducing CO2 emissions, alongside energy conservation and low-carbon energy sources such as renewables and carbon capture and storage.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,Are there errors in the IPCC reports?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Every five to seven years, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) produces a detailed and influential report summarising the science of climate change. The accuracy of these documents came under scrutiny in early 2010, after two highly publicised errors were discovered in the 'Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability' part of the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). One was the claim that Himalayan glaciers could disappear by 2035 – hundreds of years earlier than the accepted figure – and the other was an incorrect number for the percentage of land in the Netherlands that is below sea level. Both mistakes were acknowledged by the IPCC and corrected in statements and errata notes.

Some commentators who don't accept the mainstream scientific view on global warming took these errors as evidence for low standards in climate science. But senior figures in the IPCC argued that a small number of errors is hard to avoid in a document of almost 3000 pages produced by more than 1000 authors.

Partly in response to the errors, a number of reviews of the IPCC's work took place, including one by the InterAcademy Council (IAC), the umbrella group for the world's scientific academies. The review found that the IPCC assessment process had been successful overall but made a series of recommendations on issues ranging from governance to communications that it said would enhance the IPCC's ability to conduct authoritative assessments going forward. The IPCC introduced a number of changes as a result of the review and in May 2011 the IAC issued a statement saying that it was ""pleased that so many of our report's recommendations were adopted"".

Much of the debate around the glacier error centred around the use of so-called 'grey' literature – evidence that hasn't undergone a formal peer-reviewed process. The 2035 melting claim was traced to report by charity WWF, which was in turn based on an interview with a glaciologist published in popular magazine New Scientist. The head of the IPCC subsequently defended the use of some grey literature – such as reports from international agencies – but said that it had to be closely examined to ensure that errors aren't introduced.

The first part of AR4, which deals with existence of man-made climate change, relies less on grey literature and no substantive errors have been identified in it to date. You can read the errata list here.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Are solar, wind and marine power too intermittent to be useful?",q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind, marine and solar helps to cut carbon emissions by reducing the need for fossil fuel power generation. Renewable energy can also diversify supplies, helping to make a power system more resilient to failures and less exposed to fluctuating fuel prices. However, renewables pose a challenge in the form of intermittency, as their output varies with the available sunlight, wind speeds and wave activity.
In off-grid situations – for example in remote regions of developing countries – intermittency is typically dealt with using a battery, which gets charged up when power is available and stores the electricity until it's needed. But most of the world's renewables power sources are connected to an electricity grid and in this situation intermittency can be accommodated by varying the output of fossil fuel power plants.

Even on a grid with no renewables, fossil fuel plants needs to be adjusted over time to match demand to supply and allow for power station breakdowns. When renewables are included in the energy mix, the output of these fossil fuel plants may need to be adjusted more frequently. Some power stations will run below their maximum output to allow this, and additional fast-responding plants may be needed. Efficiency may be reduced as a result. But overall, these effects are usually much smaller than the savings in fuel and emissions that renewables can deliver.

Managing intermittency while keeping the system reliable can add costs. When renewables supply only a small proportion of the power on a grid this effect is negligible but as the proportion increases the costs can become more significant. For example, estimates suggest that managing intermittency would add about 1p to a unit of wind energy in the UK should wind supply around 30% of electricity. (That's around a tenth of the current retail cost of power.)

In some situations, however, renewables can help meet peak demand, reducing the need for grid upgrading or new power stations. For example, in cities where the peak demand is for air-conditioning, solar generators can help supply power at peak times. Solar power can make a strong contribution to daytime power needs even in cloudier countries, as German experience has shown. Moreover, modern weather forecasting means that wind speeds can be predicted quite accurately over four-hour periods. This allows a planned response to variable generation.

In future, other options for managing intermittency may become cheaper. This will decrease the cost of adding renewables to the grid and allow the share of renewables to grow. Connecting grids over large geographical areas allows renewable power from a variety of climates to be combined, reducing overall variability and sharing out 'backup' fossil fuel power stations more widely. Storing electricity tends to be expensive, but innovation in storage technologies could make electrical backup systems cheaper. Finally, changes in consumer behaviour can help balance renewable electricity supply and demand. For example, the introduction of 'smart' meters will allow prices to be changed across the day to encourage people to shift consumption towards times of abundant supply. Householders in the UK have already been found to reduce their overall power use and shift towards daytime consumption after installing solar on their homes.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,Why do economists describe climate change as a 'market failure'?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"When free markets do not maximise society's welfare, they are said to 'fail' and policy intervention may be needed to correct them. Many economists have described climate change as an example of a market failure – though in fact a number of distinct market failures have been identified.

The core one is the so-called 'greenhouse-gas externality'. Greenhouse gas emissions are a side-effect of economically valuable activities. Most of the impacts of emissions do not fall on those conducting the activities – instead they fall on future generations or people living in developing countries, for example – so those responsible for the emissions do not pay the cost. The adverse effects of greenhouse gases are therefore 'external' to the market, which means there is usually only an ethical – rather than an economic – incentive for businesses and consumers to reduce their emissions. As a result, the market fails by over-producing greenhouse gases.

Economists concerned about this market failure argue for policy intervention to increase the price of activities that emit greenhouse gases, thereby providing a clear signal to guide economic decision-making at the same time as stimulating innovation of low-carbon technologies. In order to ensure that emissions cuts are spread out across the economy as inexpensively as possible, economists tend to favour policies that ensure that all businesses and households face the same price on carbon – such as a tax on emissions or an emissions trading scheme.

The greenhouse gas externality is accompanied by a number of other market failures, including those arising from a lack of information about how to reduce emissions, network effects and a lack of innovation incentives. These call for a package of interventions including, but not restricted to, a price on carbon, according to economists concerned about climate change.

For example, new networks are likely to be important in several areas of low-carbon energy supply – such as the 'smart' electricity grid and electric vehicle charging points. But such networks can be difficult to establish through market forces alone, because in the early days of a network the benefits may be very limited, despite the potentially huge benefits that can be achieved once the network reaches a critical mass. Take electric vehicles: they're inconvenient if charging points are few and far between, but much more useful once a large network of charging points is established. (This is an example of a positive type of externality: when a network increases in size, every member of the network benefits, even though they have not paid for this benefit.) As a result, policy support may sometimes be necessary to help kick-start useful networks.

In the case of innovation, markets currently fail to offer sufficient incentives for the development of low-carbon technologies. An innovative idea that can be copied or used with no financial payment for its inventor may not materialise in the first place, as there is little incentive to invest in developing the idea. Policy interventions such as subsidies for R&D can help to overcome this barrier.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What is global dimming?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Measurements from the 1960s to the early 1990s, backed up by a wide range of data and a number of independent studies, showed there were substantial declines in the amount of the sun's energy reaching the Earth's surface. This reduction is known as ""global dimming"".

The observed ""dimming"" has strong regional differences across the globe. While the southern hemisphere saw modest dimming in the period 1961–90 (which has continued to date), the northern hemisphere saw much more significant declines (reductions of 4–8%). Since then some parts of the world, such as Europe and North America, have seen partial recovery (known as ""brightening""), while other regions (most notably China and India) have seen further although regionally mixed declines.

Global dimming is not thought to be due to changes in the sun's luminosity, as these have been too small to explain the magnitude of dimming observed. Instead, air pollution from human activity is thought to be the major contributor. Aerosols which form from pollution can directly reflect and absorb radiation before it reaches the planet's surface and make clouds brighter and longer lasting, meaning they reflect more sunlight.

While we cannot rule out the possibility that natural variations in the Earth's climate (via naturally occurring cloud variations) have contributed to global dimming, the effects are so closely correlated to trends in atmospheric pollution that there is strong evidence to say human activity is a major player. For example, European and North American clean air legislation in the 1990s corresponded to brightening in these regions. By contrast, China and India have seen further dimming, matching pollution increases from rapid industrialisation.

Global dimming is thought to have had a number of substantial impacts. For example, there is evidence to suggest it has masked part of the historical warming caused by greenhouse gases. Indeed, areas that have undergone brightening have seen rapid warming.
Future global dimming changes can be expected to be closely tied to emissions of atmospheric pollution. Another factor which has not played much of a role historically but which may become more significant in the future is the impact of greenhouse gas warming on global dimming. Warming of higher levels of the atmosphere leads to increased atmospheric water vapour, which in turn absorbs some of the sun's energy before it reaches the surface. If future global warming proves to be substantial, widespread dimming by water vapour could be a consequence – though the cooling effect of this would be unlikely to reduce the overall warming trend significantly.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What's a carbon footprint and how is it worked out?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"A carbon footprint is an estimate of the climate change impact of activity – such as making a product, living a lifestyle or running a company.

Typically, a carbon footprint is calculated by estimating not just the CO2 emissions that the activity in question causes, but also any emissions of other greenhouse gases (such as methane and nitrous oxide) and in some cases other types of climate impacts as well, such as vapour trails from aeroplanes. For simplicity, all these impacts are added together and expressed as a single number in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e): the amount of CO2 that would create the same amount of warming.

There are many existing and evolving standards for calculating carbon footprints but in truth no footprint is precise. Even for simple activities such as burning a litre of petrol, which releases a known amount of CO2, there are still uncertainties about the emissions caused by extracting and refining the petrol before it was burned. For more complicated activities these uncertainties are greatly multiplied. As Mike Berners-Lee explains in his book, How Bad Are Bananas?, The Carbon Footprint of Everything:

    The true carbon footprint of a plastic toy includes not only the direct emissions resulting from the manufacturing process and the transportation of the toy to the shop: it also includes a whole host of indirect emissions, such as those caused by the extraction and processing of the oil used to make the plastic in the first place. These are just a few of the processes involved. If you think about it, tracing back all the things that have to happen to make that toy leads to an infinite number of pathways. To make the point clearly, let's try following just one of those pathways. The staff in the offices of the plastic factory used paper clips made of steel. Within the footprint of that steel is a small allocation to take account of the maintenance of a digger in the iron mine that the steel originally came from … and so on for ever.

The traditional way of estimating a carbon footprint – so-called 'lifecycle assessment' – involves adding up as many of the emissions pathways as is feasible. An alternative approach is to use so-called 'input-output' analysis. This aims to avoid missing out pathways by taking the total emissions of a country or region, dividing it lots of sectors (e.g. toy manufacturing, food growing, freight, etc) and estimating the total emissions that each sector accounts for. Those figures can then be used to estimate the footprint of, say, each pound spent on toys.

There are many 'carbon calculators' on the web to help people work out the carbon footprint of their life or individual activities such as flights. However, the answers can vary widely between websites depending on the methodology used. For example, one website might focus only on the fuel use involved in flying while another might include an estimate of the climate impact of the vapour trails caused by the plane. Similarly, one website might estimate a person's footprint based only on their home energy and travel, while another might include an estimate of all the goods and services they consume, from clothes and computers to education and healthcare.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,Do temperature records reliably show the planet is warming?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Global temperature records are crucial to scientific assessment of climate change, so many steps are taken to ensure that the records are reliable and that any factors which could cause biases are accounted for.

One example is ""urban heat islands"" – the phenomenon of temperatures in cities being higher than those in rural locations. To make sure records from cities don't skew the bigger picture, estimates of global warming either omit urban stations or compensate for them by incorporating adjustments based on differences between temperatures at urban and rural sites.

Air temperatures are also screened against other air temperatures from nearby locations to detect erroneous values, false trends and jumps which are then corrected or removed.

Sea surface temperature records are also quality-checked and any issues are accounted for. For example, observations are adjusted to take into account past changes of instrumentation – such as adjusting for the evaporative cooling effect on water temperatures taken from buckets hauled onto deck.

As well as all these checks and measures on data, there are other factors which increase our confidence in the warming observed in surface temperature records. The reality of recent global warming is shown by multiple strands of evidence. The case is all the stronger because the different types of observation are made independently.

The rise in sea surface temperatures measured by ships and buoys in situ is corroborated by warming detected by satellite instruments after exhaustive quality-assurance to remove the influences of cloud and dust and to ensure consistency between successive satellites.

Yet another set of instruments monitoring the sub-surface ocean down to 2000 metres finds warming there too, not at every point but on average worldwide. Satellite and in situ observations also show widespread warming of lakes.

Temperatures measured in the lowest 10km of the air show warming comparable to that at the surface, while higher up – in the stratosphere – there has been cooling (as expected), partly as a result of greenhouse gases reducing the amount of warmth escaping from the lower atmosphere.

Indirect evidence of warming includes increasing moisture in the air – warmer air can hold more water vapour. Almost universal retreat of glaciers is another, highly visual piece of indirect evidence for global warming. Observed global sea level rise is partly a consequence of melting glaciers and partly a result of the expansion of the oceans as they warm.

So multiple strands of evidence measuring various different indicators of climate all show the expected changes associated with rising air temperatures. ",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,Is there enough time to prevent widespread thawing of permafrost?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"As we've noted in this series, scientists are concerned that global warming could cause much of the world's permafrost (deep-frozen soils) to thaw, releasing vast quantities of greenhouse gases that would accelerate climate change – an example of a positive feedback loop.

Measurements have shown that southerly permafrost regions have already started to thaw and some additional thawing is unavoidable. Even if all man-made emissions ceased today, an additional global warming of about 0.6C would be expected due to the inertia of the climate system. Furthermore, due to polar amplification, man-made warming affects permafrost regions disproportionately: they warm around 50% more than the globe as a whole.

However, according to recent modeling work, if global emissions are cut rapidly and deeply enough to meet the world's stated target of limiting the average global temperature rise to 2C above pre-industrial levels, the majority of the world's permafrost will remain frozen.

By contrast, in a scenario without polities to reduce emissions, future warming is very likely to lead to a widespread disintegration of permafrost by the end of this century. In this scenario, the Arctic, which currently is an overall carbon sink, is expected to turn into a carbon source, because the carbon uptake from Arctic vegetation will be smaller than the release of carbon from thawing permafrost soils. The loss of permafrost carbon to the atmosphere would be irreversible on a human timescale and would mean that larger reductions in man-made emissions would be needed to achieve any target for CO2 concentration or global temperature rise.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,The world's temperature has always changed. What's different now?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"The Earth's climate has fluctuated throughout its history, with both warmer and colder phases than those we experience now. These past climatic changes were caused by natural ""forcings"" – things such as changes in solar activity, Earth's position relative to the sun, changes in atmospheric CO2 driven by emissions from volcanoes and ecosystems, and natural fluctuations within the climate system such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation or the Arctic Oscillation.

The recent rise in temperature over the last century of around 0.75C is different to previous climatic change because it involves a new forcing: greenhouse gas emissions from human activity, which have driven atmospheric CO2 to its highest level for 15m years. Using climate models, scientists have shown that natural forcings alone can't account for the rise in average global temperature. But the temperature rise does fit with what scientists would expect from a mixture of natural and human forcings.

The rate at which humans are releasing CO2 into the atmosphere is exceptional. Over the last 15m years atmospheric CO2 has regularly risen and fallen – due to natural processes – between 180 and 280 parts per million (ppm). Each time carbon dioxide increased by 100ppm it took between 5,000 and 20,000 years. In contrast, it has taken only 120 years since the Industrial Revolution for atmospheric carbon dioxide to increase by around 100ppm due to human activity.

The closest match to present-day climate change in the geological past is an episode known as the Palaeo-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), around 55 million years ago. During the PETM the average global temperature rose by between 5 and 8°C in just a few thousand years – but even this relatively rapid change is slower than the current rate of global warming.

Like today's warming, the PETM is thought to have been caused by greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere – but from natural sources and at only a tenth of the rate of our current greenhouse gas emissions.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,How do we know how warm or cold it was in the past?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Scientists today measure the Earth's surface temperature using thermometers at weather stations and on ships and buoys all over the world. Such thermometer records cover a large fraction of the globe going back to the mid-19th century, allowing scientists to determine a global average temperature trend for the last 160 years.

Before that time not many thermometer records are available, so scientists use indirect temperature measurements, supported by anecdotal evidence recorded by diarists, and the few thermometer records that do exist. Scientists must rely solely on indirect methods to look back further than recorded human history.

Indirect ways of assessing past temperatures, using so-called temperature proxies, take measurements of responses to past temperature change that are preserved in natural archives such as ice, rocks and fossils.

For example, ice sheets form as snow builds up, with each year's snowfall preserved as a single, visible layer. There are measurable chemical differences in snow formed at different temperatures, so ice cores provide a record of polar temperature going back around 250,000 years for Greenland and 800,000 years for Antarctica.

Yearly banding is also found in fossilised corals and lake sediment deposits, and each band has a specific chemistry that reflects the temperature when it formed. Growth rings in tree trunks can be wider or thinner depending on the climate at the time of growth, so fossilised trees can reveal the length of growing seasons. And fossilised or frozen pollen grains allow scientists to determine what plants were growing in the past, which can give us a good idea of the climate at the time.

Marine sediment cores provide temperature records spanning millions of years. They contain the fossilised shells of tiny marine creatures that preserve a chemical record of the sea temperature when they lived.

To make their temperature reconstructions as accurate as possible scientists have calibrated each proxy by testing how it changes in response to changing temperature. However, the further back in time we look, the more sparse the proxy temperature records become. Therefore the most reliable way to work out past temperatures is to combine different proxies – and to use data from many locations to screen out local temperature fluctuations.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What is permafrost and how does it relate to climate change?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Permafrost is soil that has remained below 0C (32F) for more than two years. It occurs in regions where the summer warmth fails to penetrate the ground sufficiently to thaw the soil. These conditions prevail in high-latitude or high-mountain areas that cover roughly a quarter of the Earth's land surface – including Alaska, Canada and Siberia. The thickness of permafrost ranges from a few metres to many hundreds of metres, depending on the local climate.

Due to climate change, soil temperatures are rising. This can be seen in long-term borehole measurements from different permafrost zones, which show a significant warming trend during the past 30 years. The permafrost layer is thinned by warming, and disappears entirely if the warming is sufficiently great and sustained.

In the near term, thawing permafrost can cause serious local problems – such as damaging or buildings and other infrastructure – but the larger concern around permafrost thaw relates to greenhouse gas emissions.

Permafrost soils are extremely rich in organic carbon. According to one estimate they contain about 1700 billion tonnes of it – about twice the total amount of carbon currently in the atmosphere. When the soil remains deep-frozen, the carbon is largely inert, but when the permafrost thaws, the decomposition of organic matter through microbial activity increases sharply – with the consequence that large amounts of carbon will eventually get respired into the atmosphere as CO2 and (to a lesser extent) methane.

This is an example of a positive feedback loop, because the greenhouse gases released by the thawing permafrost will exacerbate the warming, leading to more permafrost thawing, more warming, and so on. One recent study estimated that about one-tenth of the permafrost carbon pool might get released by 2100 under a scenario with strong future warming – equivalent to around twenty years of man-made CO2 emissions at current rates. More still would be released over subsequent centuries, and the process would not be readily reversible.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,Is Antarctica getting warmer and gaining ice?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Almost 70% of the globe's fresh water is stored as ice in Antarctica, mostly in the huge ice sheet covering the continent. As well as this land-based ice, the sea ice that encircles the continent grows to a wide expanse in winter and almost entirely melts away during the summer.

While global temperatures have increased, overall Antarctic air temperatures have fallen slightly, although they have increased over the Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica. At the same time, the overall extent of Antarctic sea ice has slightly increased – by about 1% per decade since satellite records began in 1979.

Scientists trying to resolve these two trends have suggested that the sea ice growth could be happening because the ozone hole over Antarctica is affecting weather patterns in the region. They think changes in weather may be enhancing offshore winds, which spread the sea ice out by pushing it away from the continent. Another theory is that the amount of freshwater in the Southern Ocean has increased, diluting the salt content of the seawater, altering ocean circulation patterns and aiding sea ice growth.

But increasing sea ice is only a small part of the Antarctic story. Scientists have also used satellite observations of the land-based ice sheet to measure whether the Antarctic ice sheet has been losing or gaining ice.

Attempts to answer the question came up with estimates ranging from an increase of about 100bn tonnes of ice per year since the 1960s to a loss of 200bn tonnes a year over the same period. However, more recent reports agree that the ice sheet is losing ice – and indeed that the rate of loss has been speeding up.

Ice loss is not uniform over the whole of the ice sheet. Eastern Antarctica was initially found to be relatively stable, with most of the ice being lost in Western Antarctica, particularly around the Antarctic Peninsula. These regional differences in ice loss fit with the pattern of temperature change over the ice sheet. ",a

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Although there is widespread agreement on the need for adaptation measures to limit the risks posed by climate change, there is no clear consensus on how much adaptation will cost or how it will be paid for. A recent World Bank report suggested that the price of adaptation in developing countries alone will be $70–100 billion a year between 2010 and 2050, while other studies suggest these figures are too low.

The overall bill for adaptation will depend on the severity of climatic changes and the range of measures chosen. The most expensive adaptation measures involve modifying infrastructure and improving coastal and flood protection, so costs will be highest not necessarily where vulnerability is greatest but in regions with a lot of infrastructure that needs to be climate-proofed. Lower-cost measures that can be used as part of an adaptation response include changing behaviours, shifting farming practices and making regulatory reforms.
Costs will be lower if countries plan ahead – for example building roads with drainage systems that can cope with severe rain, rather than retro-fitting these features later on.

Developed countries will need to fund their own climate change adaptation measures from government funds or private investments. Companies will have to adapt their activities, whilst governments will have a role in protecting national infrastructure, setting guidelines and providing social protection. Some costs will also be borne by individuals and households, such as purchasing flood insurance or adjusting heating or cooling in the home.

Adaptation in developing countries will be financed through a variety of means. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has enshrined the principle that developed countries should transfer funds to developing countries to support adaptation. Article 4.4 of the Convention states that developed countries should assist countries ""particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in meeting costs of adaptation to those adverse effects"". This is due to the principle of ""common but differentiated responsibilities"" that has been agreed within the Convention to reflect the fact that developed countries have had a greater role historically in causing climate change.

The UNFCCC institutions have set up a number of funding mechanisms for channelling this assistance – such as the Adaptation Fund and the Least Developed Countries Fund – and funds have also been set up through multilateral agencies such as the World Bank. However, so far the amounts pledged for these funds do not cover the projected costs of adaptation. In addition, there is a significant gap between the amounts pledged and the amounts actually deposited in the funds. There has also been controversy over the relationship between adaptation funding and development aid. Developing countries argue these should be separate, and adaptation funding additional to any existing development funding.

In the Copenhagen Accord of 2009, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion in additional finance by 2012 (called fast-start finance) and $100 billion a year by 2020 to be shared between adaptation and mitigation measures. There are no definitive data on how the money will be spent, but according to one estimate, only about $3 billion of the fast-start finance pledged as of early 2012 is for adaptation measures.

There is an ongoing debate about how more money for adaptation could be found. Options being explored include levies on aviation and shipping, carbon taxes, a tax on the carbon market and a financial transaction tax.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What is climate change adaptation?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"There are two main policy responses to climate change: mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation addresses the root causes, by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, while adaptation seeks to lower the risks posed by the consequences of climatic changes. Both approaches will be necessary, because even if emissions are dramatically decreased in the next decade, adaptation will still be needed to deal with the global changes that have already been set in motion.

Humans have been adapting to their environments throughout history by developing practices, cultures and livelihoods suited to local conditions – from the Mediterranean siesta to the Vietnamese practice of building homes on stilts to protect against monsoonal rains. However, climate change raises the possibility that existing societies will experience climatic shifts (in temperature, storm frequency, flooding and other factors) that previous experience has not prepared them for.

Adaptation measures may be planned in advance or put in place spontaneously in response to a local pressure. They include large-scale infrastructure changes – such as building defences to protect against sea-level rise or improving the quality of road surfaces to withstand hotter temperatures – as well behavioural shifts such as individuals using less water, farmers planting different crops and more households and businesses buying flood insurance.

The IPCC describes vulnerability to climate change as being determined by three factors: exposure to hazards (such as reduced rainfall), sensitivity to those hazards (such as an economy dominated by rain-fed agriculture), and the capacity to adapt to those hazards (for example, whether farmers have the money or skills to grow more drought-resistant crops). Adaptation measures can help reduce vulnerability – for example by lowering sensitivity or building adaptive capacity – as well as allowing populations to benefit from opportunities of climatic changes, such as growing new crops in areas that were previously unsuitable.

Low-income countries tend to be more vulnerable to climate risks and some adaptation measures – such as increasing access to education and health facilities – will overlap with existing development programmes. But adaptation goes beyond just development to include measures to address additional risks specifically caused by climate change, such as raising the height of sea defences. It is still unclear how expensive these measures will be or who will pay for them, but the World Bank suggests adaptation could cost the same again as the world currently spends on development assistance.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,Why does climate change get described as a 'stock-flow' problem?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Economists often describe climate change as a 'stock-flow' problem. This refers to the fact that the greenhouse effect, and in turn climate change, depends on the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere – the 'stock' – while the thing humans can control as a response is the rate at which additional greenhouse gases are emitted – the 'flow'.

The total stock of atmospheric greenhouse gases depends on the difference between man-made emissions and the natural removal of greenhouse gases from the air, particularly by oceans and plant life.

Imagine a bathtub. The tub itself represents the atmosphere and the water it contains represents the stock of greenhouse gases. The taps represent manmade emissions, whilst a slow-draining plug represents the natural removal of greenhouse gases. If the taps are left running and the plug can only drain the liquid away slowly, the volume of water in the tub will increase. That's what's happening at present: humans are adding greenhouse gases to the air faster than natural processes can remove them. The result is an increasing stock of greenhouse gases and, in turn, rising temperatures.

To arrest man-made global warming, the world needs to stop the atmospheric stock of greenhouse gases from increasing. This requires emissions to be reduced until they balance with the rate of natural removal from the atmosphere. At this point the atmospheric stock is stabilised, which is why many economists and scientists talk about targets for 'stabilisation'.

The lower the level at which the atmospheric stock of greenhouse gases is stabilised, the greater the chance the world will have of meeting its agreed target to limit global temperature rise to 2C. For a 50% chance of success, scientists recommend that annual emissions should peak and fall to 40–48 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2020, before eventually falling to 14–17 billion tonnes in 2050. Annual global emissions were around 50 billion tonnes in 2010 and are continuing to rise, so fast action will be needed if these targets are to be met.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,How long do greenhouse gases stay in the air?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Aside from water vapour, the four principal greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and the halocarbons or CFCs (gases containing fluorine, chlorine and bromine). These gases – described in more detail here – can remain in the atmosphere for different amounts of time, from months to millennia, and affect the climate on very different timescales.

The lifetime in the air of CO2, the most significant man-made greenhouse gas, is probably the most difficult to determine, because there are several processes that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Between 65% and 80% of CO2 released into the air dissolves into the ocean over a period of 20–200 years. The rest is removed by slower processes that take up to several hundreds of thousands of years, including chemical weathering and rock formation. This means that once in the atmosphere, carbon dioxide can continue to affect climate for thousands of years.

Methane, by contrast, is mostly removed from the atmosphere by chemical reaction, persisting for about 12 years. Thus although methane is a potent greenhouse gas, its effect is relatively short-lived.

Nitrous oxide is destroyed in the stratosphere and removed from the atmosphere more slowly than methane, persisting for around 114 years.

Compounds containing chlorine and/or fluorine (CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs, PFCs) include a huge number of different chemical species, each of which can last in the atmosphere for a specific length of time – from less than a year to many thousands of years. The IPCC has published a comprehensive list of the atmospheric lifetime of the various CFCs and other greenhouse gases.

Water vapour is a very effective absorber of heat energy in the air, but it does not accumulate in the atmosphere in the same way as the other greenhouse gases. This is down to it having a very short atmospheric lifetime, of the order of hours to days, because it is rapidly removed as rain and snow. The amount of water vapour that the atmosphere can hold increases as the atmosphere gets warmer, so the greenhouse properties of water vapour are usually considered to act as part of a feedback loop, rather than a direct cause of climate change.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,Can we rely on computer models to predict future climate change?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Computer models are one of the tools that scientists use to understand the climate and make projections about how it will respond to changes such as rising greenhouse gas levels. The models are simulations of earth's climate system either at a global or regional level.

The climate system is hugely complex, and no mathematical model can perfectly reflect all of its intricate processes in perfect detail. Hence there's always some difference between a model and reality, and it's normal when presenting model results to estimate how big this difference is.

Nonetheless, scientists are confident that models can project big-picture changes such as global temperature rise. The IPCC gives three reasons for its confidence in large-scale climate modelling: the fact that the fundamentals of the models are based on well-established physical laws; the success of models at predicting or reproducing observed patterns and variability in our current and recent climate; and the success of models at reproducing past changes in our climate, including global temperature changes.

Comparing models developed independently by different centres around the world provides additional confidence where those models agree on the response (typically on global and continental scales). To minimise the impact of inaccuracy in any one model, scientists can simulate the same scenarios in multiple models and compare the outcomes.

When models are used to provide information about more localised parts of the climate – for example, over a particular country or region – the results become more uncertain. However, the quality of regional models is improving, increasing the confidence with which they can predict local features such as rainfall.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,How will climate change affect rainfall?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Changes in rainfall and other forms of precipitation will be one of the most critical factors determining the overall impact of climate change. Rainfall is much more difficult to predict than temperature but there are some statements that scientists can make with confidence about the future.

A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, and globally water vapour increases by 7% for every degree centigrade of warming. How this will translate into changes in global precipitation is less clear cut but the total volume of precipitation is likely to increase by 1-2% per degree of warming.

There's evidence to show that regions that are already wet are likely to get wetter, but details on how much wetter and what impacts there will be on a local scale are more difficult to ascertain. The dry regions of the subtropics are likely to get drier and will shift towards the poles. For much of Europe, wetter winters are expected, but with drier summers over central and southern Europe.

It is the changes in weather patterns that make predicting rainfall particularly difficult. While different climate models are in broad agreement about future warming on a global scale, when it comes to predicting how these changes will impact weather – and consequently rainfall – there is less agreement at a detailed level.

It is likely that in a warmer climate heavy rainfall will increase and be produced by fewer more intense events. This could lead to longer dry spells and a higher risk of floods.

So far, any impact that climate change may have had generally on regional rainfall cannot be distinguished from natural variations. However, for some specific cases a signal is starting to emerge. A recent study showed that man-made climate change substantially increased the odds of damaging floods occurring in England and Wales in autumn 2000. For the UK, current understanding suggests that increases in heavy rainfall during winter may start to become discernible more generally in the 2020s.

Climate models and observations are improving all the time and the reliability of predictions is likely to improve significantly over the next few years. In particular, new satellites and more detailed models are opening up new possibilities for understanding and predicting how water cycles through the climate system.

For example, current climate models typically represent atmospheric processes only down to scales of about 50-100km. This limits their ability to incorporate the effects of mountains and coastlines and means that small-scale processes, such as convection, must be represented by average approximations. In addition, the latest regional climate models capture daily rainfall on large scales but are not good at capturing heavier or more localised events.

However, the latest generation of localised weather forecasting models represent scales down to 1km and can capture these localised features. Scientists are now starting to apply these models to climate change studies, raising the possibility of much more confidence in their predictions of changes in extreme rainfall.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"If the world is warming, why were the past two winters so cold?",q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"The winters of 2009–10 and 2010–11 in the UK were the coldest in the previous 25 years. This has been taken by some commentators and members of the public as evidence that global warming isn't happening. In truth, however, cold UK winters are entirely possible within broader global warming trends.

Scientists have determined that the Earth's climate is warming by averaging measurements from all over the globe over many decades. Indeed, 2010 was one of the warmest years on record. But natural climate variability means there are plenty of local or temporary events – such as cold winters – that appear to contradict the warming trend.

Consistent with this is the fact that not everywhere in the Northern Hemisphere was unusually cold over in the winters of 2009–10 and 2010–11. While the UK, northern Europe and the eastern US have been subject to two very cold winters, the last two winters in northeast Canada and Greenland have been unusually mild.

Climatologists put this regional temperature pattern down to the position of the jet stream – the current of air high in the atmosphere that steers weather systems in the Northern Hemisphere. At the surface, these changes appear as variations in the pressure difference between high pressure mid-latitude and low pressure polar air.

Some years see smaller pressure differences than normal – a condition scientists call the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). This causes the jet stream to weaken and to shift south to the Mediterranean, cutting off our supply of mild, Atlantic air and allowing more frequent incursions of cold air from continental Europe and Russia.

Scientists are still investigating what causes the negative NAO that brings us cold winter weather. Studies show an influence on the NAO from El Niño and La Niña – the spreading of warmer- or cooler-than-normal waters across the equatorial Pacific that is known to influence global climate patterns. There's also evidence that low phases of the sun's 11-year activity cycle might influence the NAO and thus bring cold winters to Britain.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What is the IPCC?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a United Nations body, founded in 1988, which evaluates climate change science.

The IPCC assesses research on climate change and synthesises it into major 'assessment' reports every 5–7 years. The most fourth assessment report – often referred to as AR4 – was published in 2007 and totals more than 2,800 pages. The fifth (AR5) is scheduled to be published during 2013 and 2014.

IPCC assessments are produced in three volumes, each of which is prepared by a working group. Working Group One (WG1) examines scientific evidence for climate change and the extent to which human activity is the cause. Working Group Two (WG2) focuses on the impacts of climate change, and how plants, animals and humans can adapt. Working Group Three (WG3) focuses on climate mitigation. The research, writing and reviewing involved in each IPCC assessment report takes several years.

The scientists who undertake the IPCC review process assess the peer-reviewed scientific literature, but also consider what is termed 'grey literature' – research material that is not been peer reviewed. The vast majority of material included is peer-reviewed – more than 90% in the case Working Group 1 in AR4.

The IPCC process involves hundreds of scientists and draws on the work of thousands more. Most contribute as volunteers. The IPCC secretariat employs ten staff and each working group has a small administrative staff. These are based at the University of Bern (WG1), Stanford's Carnegie Institute for Science (WG2) and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (WG3).

The IPCC itself is comprised of representatives from 194 governments who review the contents of reports before publication and have to agree the final text. Professor Paul Edwards, historian and professor of information at Michigan University, writes in his book A Vast Machine that ""IPCC draft reports undergo more scrutiny than any other documents in the history of science"".

Governments and NGOs recommend academics to be considered for inclusion in the working groups which author the IPCC Reports, and the IPCC Bureau, the organisation's coordinating body, selects the final list of experts. Details of the 831 AR5 authors and editors are available on the IPCC website.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What's the target for solving climate change?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Climate change targets can be highly confusing. There are various types of targets, and lots of uncertainty about how each target could be met and what would happen if it was. Let's look at the three main types of target in turn.
Temperature targets

Ultimately, temperature rise is the thing that matters, as warming causes all the other symptoms of climate change. There's no agreement about what constitutes a ""safe"" temperature rise but in the hope of reducing the risks to an acceptable level – and in particular to try and limit the chance of crossing ""tipping points"" in the climate system – most of the world's nations have signed up to a non-legally binding target of limiting temperature rise to 2C above pre-industrial levels.

However, this target isn't universally accepted. Some of the countries most exposed to climate change – such as low-lying islands at risk of rising sea levels – have called for 1.5C as a maximum allowable temperature rise. And one recent scientific paper said that accepting a temperature rise as large as 2C could be a ""prescription for disaster"".

On the other hand, many experts think even 2C is too low to be an achievable target, because the world has already warmed more than 0.7C and scientists expect that it would warm another 0.6C even if we cut emissions to zero tomorrow. That doesn't leave much space to wind-down our fossil fuel use.

Temperature targets can refer either to the level at which the global temperature stabilises (e.g. levelling off and remaining at 2C) or to a peak (e.g. reaching 2C and then falling to a lower level).
Concentration targets

Humans don't determine the global temperature directly, but by affecting the concentration of greenhouse gases in the air. To meet any temperature target, therefore, the world need to reduce its emissions sufficiently to stabilise that concentration an appropriate level.

Concentration targets can be particularly confusing because ""concentration"" can refer to three different things:

the concentration only of carbon dioxide, the main man-made greenhouse gas, as measured in parts of CO2 per million (ppm)
the combined impact of all the man-made greenhouse gases measured in ppm of CO2e (the amount of CO2 that would be required to create an equivalent amount of warming)
the combined impact of man-made greenhouse gases plus the cooling effect of man-made aerosol pollution, also measured in CO2e

To confuse things further, we don't know exactly how sensitive the climate will prove to be to increased greenhouse gas concentration. That means each concentration target could lead to a range of possible temperatures. Picking a concentration target is therefore partly a matter of deciding how much risk we're prepared to take of hitting or exceeding 2C or any other temperature target.

There isn't currently an agreed global target for greenhouse gas concentration, though 450 ppm CO2e (for all greenhouse gases) is frequently cited as a sensible place for the world to aim. Assuming mid-range estimates for climate sensitivity, 450 CO2e ppm would give us a roughly 50% chance of limiting temperatures to 2C according to the last IPCC report. Above that concentration, our chances of avoiding 2C decline; below it, they improve.

Another much-cited target is stabilising CO2 (as opposed to all greenhouse gases) at 350ppm. This would mean reducing the concentration from the current level, which is around 390ppm and rising each year. If this could be achieved – which would most likely entail removing some of the CO2 currently in the air in addition to rapidly reducing emissions virtually to zero – then it might allow global temperatures to level off at around 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, according to the UK's Met Office – though the situation would depend on what happens to emissions of the other greenhouse gases.

The 350 ppm CO2 target was the original rationale for the name of the 350.org campaign – though the group now argues that, due to global warming happening faster than previously thought, the world should instead aim for 350ppm CO2e. This is an even more ambitious target which could see global temperatures stabilised at around 1C above pre-industrial levels, according to the Met Office. Again, though, it's unlikely such a target could be achieved without a significant global effort to remove CO2 from the air.
Emissions targets

Concentrations are still one step removed from direct human control. To meet any temperature or concentration target, we need emissions targets to determine how much greenhouse gas we can we can emit over what timeframe.

Sometimes emissions targets are expressed in terms of relative emissions cuts – for example, cutting global emissions by 50% by 2050, relative to 1990. However, such targets are somewhat broad-brush because they can be met in different ways. Keeping emissions flat until the 2040s and then sharply cutting them would mean far more greenhouse gas entering the atmosphere in total – and therefore a larger temperature rise – than cutting emissions sharply next year and then keeping them flat until 2050.

Less vague than a relative target is an emissions trajectory, which defines how much greenhouse gas the world emits each year going forward. (Even with a trajectory, however, there's still some uncertainty around the resulting concentration, because we don't know exactly what proportion of future emissions will be absorbed by the sea or land, as opposed to remaining in the atmosphere where they cause warming.)

A common way to define an emissions trajectory is to pick a year when global emissions should peak and an annual rate of decline from that peak. Scientists have examined lots of trajectories, each of which gives a range of likely concentrations and in turn a range of temperature outcomes. According to Met Office research, global emissions would need to peak by 2016 and decline by 4% a year to provide a 50% chance of avoiding 2C. For a better chance, we'd need to peak emissions even sooner and/or cut them even faster after the peak.

There is no internationally agreed target for peaking global emissions at present, let alone their rate of decline afterwards. At the Copenhagen climate conference, the draft ""Danish Text"" included a reference to emissions peaking no later than 2020 (and falling to 50% by 2050). But this text was abandoned and no such goal has subsequently been agreed.

One final type of emissions target is the total amount of CO2 that the world can emit over a particular period – sometimes known as a cumulative emissions target or a carbon budget. According to one landmark study, the world should limit total future emissions to around half a trillion tonnes of CO2 if we want a 50% chance of avoiding 2C.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What is thorium and how does it generate power?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Thorium is a radioactive chemical element that could in theory be used to generate large quantities of low-carbon electricity in future decades. Compared to the uranium that powers today's nuclear plants, thorium is more abundant and widely distributed in the Earth's crust. It also offers various safety benefits over uranium: it's not prone to runaway chain reactions that can lead to nuclear disasters; its waste products remains dangerous for a much shorter period; and its byproducts aren't useful for making nuclear weapons. In addition, thorium reactors could theoretically be used to burn up the dangerous plutonium stored in existing nuclear waste stockpiles.

There are various different ways that thorium can – or could – be used to generate energy. A plant being developed in India uses solid thorium fuel in water-cooled reactors similar to those found in today's uranium-based power plants. A completely different approach being explored in China and America is the liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR or ""lifter""). This technology was developed to prototype stage by the American government in the 1960s but was then shelved in favour of uranium – possibly because it didn't go hand-in-hand with weapons production. Advocates of this technology argue that its potential is far greater than the water-cooled approach, partly because LFTRs could extract a higher proportion of energy from the thorium fuel.

A third possible approach – promoted by particle physicists such as Nobel prize-winner Carlo Rubbia – would be to use thorium in sub-critical accelerator-driven reactors. However, this remains in the realm of scientific theory rather than nuclear engineering.

After decades of relative obscurity, thorium has been attracting increasing interest in recent years. In 2009, the potential of LFTRs was highlighted in the Guardian's Manchester Report, and September this year saw the launch of the Weinberg Foundation, a new pressure group seeking to accelerate the development of thorium technology. Nonetheless, it's unlikely that thorium will provide a significant proportion of the world's energy before 2030.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What was the little ice age?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"The ""little ice age"", evidence of which was first recorded around 1300, and which extended through to the mid 1800s, was the coldest interval over the Northern Hemisphere for one thousand or so years. Periodic plagues and famines ravaged Europe and glaciers descended from the Alps to engulf a number of villages.

One influence may have been a drop in solar energy. Isotopes of carbon in tree rings and beryllium in ice cores show a drop-off in solar radiation during much of the period. Moreover, sunspot observations that began around 1610 show a near-absence of reported sunspots between 1645 and 1715. However, recent studies have brought down the relative importance of this solar effect on the little ice age.

Also in the mix are volcanoes, which seem to have erupted more frequently after 1500 than during the so-called medieval warm period that preceded it. The 1815 eruption of Indonesia's Tambora – one of the most violent ever recorded on Earth – led to a disastrously cold summer across much of the globe in 1816. That ""year without a summer"" brought crop failures to northern Europe as well as snows in Vermont as late as early June.

Like the medieval warm period, the little ice age appears to have been strongest over the Northern Hemisphere's continents, although it's hard to completely eliminate geographic bias from these early records – and there's little evidence from the tropics and southern hemisphere to say what actually happened there. Some researchers argue that both phenomena were primarily regional events, as opposed to the global-scale warming under way now.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,Why do we need low-carbon energy – and how much is currently produced?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"The majority of the world's man-made carbon emissions are released by the burning fossil fuels to create electricity, heat or motion. This means that it will almost certainly be impossible to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations to sustainable levels unless large quantities of low-carbon energy can be brought on-stream to substitute for fossil fuels.

The two main sources of low-carbon energy are renewables – which includes categories such as solar, wind, hydro, biomass and marine energy – and nuclear. In terms of total primary energy supply (i.e. raw energy created), data for 2008 suggest that fossil fuels provided around 85%, nuclear contributed around 2% and renewables provided around 13%. The renewables contribution breaks down by technology as follows:

Biomass (wood, etc): 10.2%
Wind: 0.2%
Hydropower: 2.3%
Marine: 0.0002%
Geothermal: 0.1%
Solar: 0.1%

In terms of final energy consumption (i.e. the energy consumed by end-users), the contribution of low-carbon sources is slightly higher.That's because a large proportion of the energy produced from fossil fuels is wasted as heat during the conversion to electricity. One estimate for the year 2009 put the contribution of renewables to final energy consumption at 19% and nuclear at 2.9%.

Some renewable energy technologies – including solar and wind – are growing in total capacity very quickly. However, the proportion of total energy that comes from low-carbon sources in the coming years and decades will depend not just on the roll-out of renewables and nuclear, but also on total energy consumption, which without regulation at the global level could continue to grow, cancelling out the emissions savings of low-carbon sources.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What are bioenergy and biofuels – and are they a good idea?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Bioenergy describes any energy source based on biological matter – everything from an dung cooking fire or a biomass power station to ethanol-based car fuel. Unlike oil, coal or gas, bioenergy counts as a renewable energy option, because plant and animal materials can be easily regenerated. At present, bioenergy accounts for the majority of renewable energy produced globally.

The term biofuels is sometimes used interchangeably with bioenergy, though more commonly it's used specifically to describe liquid bioenergy fuels such as biodiesel (a diesel substitute) and bioethanol (which can be used in petrol engines).

Bioenergy is often considered to be environmentally friendly because, in theory, the CO2 released when plants and trees are burned is balanced out by the CO2 absorbed by the new ones planted to replace those harvested. However, the environmental and social benefits of bioenergy are hotly contested – especially in the case of biofuels, which are often produced from food crops such as palm oil, corn or sugar.

There are two main criticisms of biofuels. The first is that growing plants for energy puts pressure on land use, boosting deforestation and driving up food prices. The second is that the production of some biofuels has been linked to high levels of carbon emissions. For example, making ethanol from corn can generate large quantities of greenhouse gases through the use of tractors, fertiliser and processing plants. Similarly, biodiesel made from palm oil can have a massive carbon footprint – as well as serious negative consequences for biodiversity – if virgin rainforest is cleared to make way for the palm oil plantations.

Advocates of bioenergy argue that although some biofuels are unsustainable, others – such as biodiesel processed from used cooking oil, and wood burned in combined heat and power plants – make good environmental sense. In addition, they point out that next-generation biofuels, such as cellulosic ethanol produced from grasses, wood or straw, will create truly sustainable fuels by reducing the need for fertilisers, cropland and processing energy.

A more recent criticism of bioenergy is that it would make more sense to use all the available wood to produce building materials and furniture, rather than burning it, because this way the carbon content gets safely locked up in products and buildings for years or even centuries. Another potential way to lock-up the CO2 captured by trees and plants would be to burn them in power plants equipped with carbon capture and storage technology.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What is the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"The UN's Kyoto protocol established binding greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets for 37 industrialised countries and the European community. To help achieve these targets, the protocol introduced three ""flexible mechanisms"" – international emissions trading (IET), joint implementation (JI), and the clean development Mechanism (CDM).

To date the CDM has arguably been the most successful of the three flexible mechanisms. It has two main goals: one, to assist countries without emissions targets (ie developing countries) in achieving sustainable development. Two, help those countries with emission reduction targets under Kyoto (ie developed countries) in achieving compliance by allowing them to purchase offsets created by CDM projects.

A broad range of projects are eligible for CDM accreditation, with the notable exceptions of nuclear power and avoided deforestation projects. They vary from hydropower and wind energy projects, to fuel switching and industrial efficiency improvements. Crucially, to qualify for accreditation the project developers must prove 'additionality', defined as emissions reductions that are additional to what would have otherwise occurred. This is calculated by using an approved methodology to subtract the estimated emissions of a given project from a hypothetical 'business-as-usual' emissions baseline.

Once registered, projects are then issued Certified Emissions Reductions (CER), with each CER unit equal to a reduction of one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent. These CERs, or offsets, can be bought and used by developed countries to meet their Kyoto commitments. Companies can also purchase CERs to contribute towards their own emission reduction targets under mandatory emissions trading schemes (such as the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, ETS) or voluntary schemes.

There are currently over 3000 registered projects delivering an average of 500 million CERs per year. The overwhelming demand for CERs comes from the ETS, the world's largest functioning compliance carbon market. Between 2008 and 2010 European companies used 277million CERs to meet their emissions reductions targets.

CDM projects are not without their controversies however. Questions surround the sustainable development credentials of certain projects, particularly in the case of industrial gas projects. HFC-23 projects, for example, seem to create perverse incentives to continue to produce the ozone depleting gas HCFC-22 in order to destroy the waste gas by-product HFC-23. Indeed in response to this, starting in May 2013, the EU has banned companies covered by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme from using CERs from HFC-23 and N2O adipic acid industrial gas projects. It cited concerns regarding the environmental merits, cost-effectiveness and competitive distortions of these projects.

Concerns have also been raised regarding the conduct of project owners, with certain CDM projects implicated in land rights issues and human rights abuses. Meanwhile, the geographical distribution of CDM projects, over 80% of which originate in China and India, calls into question the ability of the CDM to drive broad engagement with sustainable development across developing countries. What's more, critics would suggest a more fundamental flaw in the CDM is that it is impossible to prove the 'additionality' of a project in comparison to a hypothetical baseline.

Counter to this are the positive achievements of the CDM. It is expected to generate as much as 1 billion tonnes of emissions reductions up to 2012, with projects in 81 countries driving investment in a market worth $19.8 billion in 2010. The CDM has created a system where emission reduction opportunities are actively sought out, and an institutional framework that stimulates secure and focused global investment in sustainable development projects.

In addition, the UN estimates that around 44% of all projects currently in the pipeline involve some form of technology transfer, with a significant proportion of this occurring in biomass energy and wind projects, methane avoidance projects, energy efficiency projects and landfill gas projects. The CDM can therefore be said to have made a considerable contribution to the development and transfer of knowledge and technology in developing countries, and positively impacted on local communities through the creation of jobs and infrastructure.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What is emissions trading?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Emissions trading is a market-based approach to controlling pollution. By creating tradable pollution permits it attempts to add the profit motive as an incentive for good performance, unlike traditional environmental regulation based solely on the threat of penalties.

Developed in the 70s and 80s, emissions trading was introduced in the US in 1990 to combat acid rain, but more recently it has grown in prominence as a way of tackling greenhouse gas emissions linked to climate change.

The main form of emissions trading is known as ""cap and trade"": a cap on emissions is set and then permits are created up to the level of this cap. The companies or other entities covered by the scheme need to hold one permit for every tonne of pollution (CO2e) they emit. Allowing a trade in these permits puts a price on pollution – the cost of emitting one tonne of carbon dioxide is the cost of the permit – and creates flexibility as to how and where pollution is reduced.

The theory is that setting a limit on pollution and allowing the market to decide how to stay within that limit is ideally suited to reducing carbon emissions, which come from almost all forms of economic activity and mix into the atmosphere with global effect. The market should ensure that the emissions cuts happen at the lowest possible cost, and the cap can be lowered year by year in a managed way.

Supporters argue that this is preferable to other forms of pricing, such as carbon taxes, which do not guarantee any particular level of reduction. However, critics often emphasise the degree to which emissions trading has been marred by weak caps, free handouts of permits to the biggest polluters and the purchase of ""offsets"" – carbon credits bought from outside the cap-and-trade system from carbon reduction projects in the developing world.

Emissions trading is a central element of the Kyoto protocol in the form of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and is the cornerstone policy of the EU, whose Emissions Trading System (ETS) is the largest in the world. The expansion of emissions trading was slowed significantly by the US decision to abandon a proposed national policy, although groups of states have set up regional schemes. A number of countries are considering the adoption of some form of cap and trade, including China and South Korea.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What is the emissions trading scheme and does it work?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"The European Union's Emissions Trading System (ETS) is the world's biggest scheme for trading greenhouse gas emissions allowances. Launched in 2005, it covers some 11,000 power stations and industrial plants in 30 countries, whose carbon emissions make up almost 50% of Europe's total.
A cap on the total emissions allowed within the scheme is set, and allowances adding up to the cap are provided to the companies regulated by the scheme. The companies are required to measure and report their carbon emissions and to hand in one allowance for each tonne they release. Companies can trade their allowances, providing an incentive for them to reduce their emissions.

The current cap is set to fall by 1.74% annually to achieve a target of reducing emissions in 2020 to 21% below their level in 2005. In June 2011 the price of an allowance was around €16. The trade in permits is worth around $150bn annually, dwarfing other emissions trading schemes (the Clean Development Mechanism market established by the UN is valued at $1.5bn annually).

In a basic sense the ETS has worked. It has set a cap on half of Europe's carbon emissions, which were previously unregulated, and the companies covered by the scheme are no longer free to pollute. Carbon has a price and this influences the economics of burning fossil fuels.

For example, burning coal creates more carbon pollution than burning gas, so coal plant operators need more permits. The higher the price of the permits, the more expensive it is to use coal rather than gas. Power companies choosing how to generate electricity therefore have an extra cost associated with the more polluting options, so they'll choose gas over coal more of the time.

Putting precise numbers on how far the ETS has worked in practice is difficult, as it means estimating what the level of pollution would have been if the ETS was not in place. It is likely, however, that in its first few years, the scheme was responsible for turning an anticipated increase in emissions into a decline of 2.5-5%. One in-depth study analysed background emissions, economic trends and weather patterns, and concluded that between 2005 and 2007 the ETS reduced emissions by 120-300m tonnes, with a best guess of 210m tonnes across Europe.

These are fairly modest gains – especially in the context of rapidly of increasing imports of carbon-intensive goods from China and elsewhere – and although steeper reductions have been set for the third 'phase' of the ETS, which runs from 2013 to 2020, the policy has been heavily criticised and beset with problems, not least of which is the large number of permits expected to be held over from the current phase. Nonetheless, Europe has a price on carbon and a working mechanism to limit and reduce climate pollution, which puts it further ahead than other major regions in the world.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,Are tornadoes affected by climate change?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Tornadoes – also known as cyclones or twisters – are rotating columns of air that run between the ground and the clouds above. Weak, short-lived tornadoes can occur when there's a strong updraft within a thunderstorm, though the most powerful and devastating twisters found in a few areas of the world require very specific conditions: a ""supercell"" thunderstorm with a rotating area called a mesocyclone, and winds that shear, increasing and shifting direction with height.

Although the number of reported tornadoes has increased over the past few decades, scientists believe this is simply because more are being documented (partly thanks to the rise of ""storm chasing"" as a hobby), rather than because climate change or any other factor has made them more frequent. This fits with the fact that US reports of violent tornadoes – the kind that are hard to miss, even without storm chasing – haven't changed significantly in the entire century-long record, holding firm at around 10–20 per year.

As for the future, there's no compelling reason to expect tornadoes to become much more frequent or intense due to global warming – though climate change could have some impact on when and where the occur. For example, it's possible that ""tornado season"" (generally early spring in the US South and late spring to summer in the Midwest) may shift a bit earlier, and the secondary autumn season could extend later. But it's also possible, according to recent research, that warming will reduce the frequency with which the required conditions for powerful tornadoes will co-exist. While the atmosphere is generally getting warmer and moister, which can boost the instability that fuels storms, it's also possible that the wind shear that organises tornadic storms will decrease. This could tip the balance away from tornadoes and towards other thunderstorm extremes, such as heavy rain.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,Could climate change be a good thing?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"A changing climate isn't inherently bad, and commentators who are sceptical about the risks posed by global warming often point to the benefits that higher temperatures could bring – such as longer growing seasons in cool countries and more efficient shipping routes through an ice-free Arctic. Even some of those who are concerned about climate change occasionally highlight opportunities that it presents, whether that's a boost to UK tourism or a shake-up of global politics.

Certainly it's true that a warmer world could benefit certain people, species, regions and industries – at least for a period. However, any such benefits need to be seen in the context of a number of serious and widespread negative consequences that scientists have warned the world to expect: things such as rising sea levels, an increase in the number of people exposed to devastating droughts and floods, and a potentially massive increase in extinction rates. That explains why world's most prestigious scientific bodies stated in 2009 that: ""It is essential that world leaders agree on the emission reductions needed to combat negative consequences of anthropogenic climate change"".
Of course, any comparison of specific positive and negative impacts is complicated by the fact that the effects of climate change will vary according to both location and time. For example, the science suggests that global agricultural productivity may increase during the first three degrees Celsius of warming, driven by gains in relatively wealthy high-latitude regions. During that time, however, productivity looks likely to fall in the poorer tropical areas, followed by a drop in global food production if the temperature warms by more than 3C – something that could be expected to put a huge strain on a world population expected to exceed nine billion by the end of the century.

This example reflects a few wider themes: that a positive benefits can give way to negative ones as the climate continues to warm; that some of the possible longer-term impacts are potentially catastrophic, compared to fairly insubstantial short-term benefits; and that the regions most exposed to the risks of climate change are very often the ones that are least responsible for causing them and least equipped to deal with them. This latter point explains why the most prominent groups campaigning on global poverty and equality see climate change as a major threat.

Ultimately, however, terms such as ""good"" and ""bad"" are subjective, so there can never be a single definitive answer to this question.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,Which industries and activities emit the most carbon?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"""Carbon"" is shorthand for greenhouse gas emissions, including CO2, methane, nitrous oxide and F-gases. These gases are released by many different types of activity – not just the burning of fossil fuels, but also farming, deforestation and some industrial processes.

Global emissions can be allocated to human activities in various ways. One of the most granular analyses is this one from the World Resources Institute (WRI), which breaks down total global emissions from 2005 into the following headline sectors:

Energy
– Electricity & heat (24.9%)
– Industry (14.7%)
– Transportation (14.3%)
– Other fuel combustion (8.6%)
– Fugitive emissions (4%)
Agriculture (13.8%)
Land use change (12.2%)
Industrial processes (4.3%)
Waste (3.2%)

These sectors are then assigned to various end uses, giving the following results (nicely visualised here):

Road transport (10.5%)
Air transport (excluding additional warming impacts) (1.7% )
Other transport (2.5%)
Fuel and power for residential buildings (10.2%)
Fuel and power for commercial buildings (6.3%)
Unallocated fuel combustion (3.8%)
Iron and steel production (4%)
Aluminium and non-ferrous metals production (1.2%)
Machinery production (1%)
Pulp, paper and printing (1.1%)
Food and tobacco industries (1.0%)
Chemicals production (4.1%)
Cement production (5.0%)
Other industry (7.0%)
Transmission and distribution losses (2.2%)
Coal mining (1.3%)
Oil and gas production (6.4%)
Deforestation (11.3%)
Reforestation (-0.4%)
Harvest and land management (1.3%)
Agricultural energy use (1.4%)
Agricultural soils (5.2%)
Livestock and manure (5.4%)
Rice cultivation (1.5%)
Other cultivation (1.7%)
Landfill of waste (1.7%)
Wastewater and other waste (1.5%)

It should be stressed that there is a fair degree of uncertainty about the precise contribution of some activities, especially those which include biological processes such as land use change and agriculture. Indeed, the total contribution from deforestation is much lower in the data above than it was in the equivalent figures from 2000, due to a change in the underlying methodology – as described in the WRI's accompanying paper (pdf).

The other point to note is that emissions levels are permanently changing. Total global emissions are significantly higher now than they were in 2005, and the ratios between sectors will also have changed. But global datasets take a long time to compile, hence there is usually a multi-year lag before reliable figures are published.

The numbers provided above are broadly consistent with the 2004 data published in the latest UN IPCC report.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What are CO2e and global warming potential (GWP)?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"CO2e, or carbon dioxide equivalent, is a standard unit for measuring carbon footprints. The idea is to express the impact of each different greenhouse gas in terms of the amount of CO2 that would create the same amount of warming. That way, a carbon footprint consisting of lots of different greenhouse gases can be expressed as a single number.

For example, in 2009, the UK released 474 million tonnes of CO2. But if you include its emissions of methane, nitrous oxide and F-gases, the country's total emissions work out at 566 million tonnes of CO2e. In other words, those extra gases added the equivalent of 92 million extra tonnes of CO2.

Standard ratios are used to convert the various gases into equivalent amounts of CO2. These ratios are based on the so-called global warming potential (GWP) of each gas, which describes its total warming impact relative to CO2 over a set period – usually a hundred years. Over this time frame, according to the standard data, methane scores 25 (meaning that one tonne of methane will cause the same amount of warming as 25 tonnes of CO2), nitrous oxide comes in at 298 and some of the super-potent F-gases score more than 10,000.

The only wrinkle with all this is that 100 years is a fairly arbitrary time frame, and the ratios change significantly if a shorter or longer period is chosen. That's because some gases last much longer in the atmosphere than others. For instance, a tonne of CO2 emissions may warm the planet gently but over many centuries. A tonne of methane emissions, by contrast, creates a strong burst of warming over a much shorter period.

Relatively speaking, therefore, the impact of methane – and the strategic importance of tackling its sources, such as agriculture and landfill sites – depends on whether you're more interested in the next few decades or the next few centuries. Over a period of 20 years, methane's GWP rises to 72; over a period of 500 years, it falls to just 7.6.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What are 'outsourced emissions'?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"The standard way of measuring a nation's carbon footprint is to add up the greenhouse gas emitted each year within its borders, plus – in a more comprehensive analysis – a proportion of the emissions from the ships and planes bringing people and products into and out of the country.

This approach has the advantage of being methodologically simple, but it means that emissions caused in the process of manufacturing or growing an item are assigned to the country where that item is produced, rather than the country where it is consumed. This, many commentators argue, is unfair, because it allows rich countries to claim that they are reducing their emissions when in fact they're just ""outsourcing"" them – relying increasingly on emerging economies such as China for carbon-intensive manufacturing processes.

One 2009 study suggested that 50% of the rise in Chinese emissions are the result of manufacturing goods for foreign markets. And a number of reports have estimated that emissions cuts made in the UK and many other developed countries – including those cuts claimed as successes under the Kyoto protocol – are more than cancelled out by the rise in emissions embodied in imported goods.

One of the challenges with measuring national carbon footprints by ""consumption"" as opposed to ""production"" is that it would be difficult to track imported and exported emissions for the whole world with a high level of accuracy (the best international dataset, published in 2011, is available here). Even if perfect and up-to-date data were available, however, a question would remain about whether it would be correct to assign all the responsibility for manufacturing emissions to the consumer nations. Some commentators argue that the responsibility should in fact be shared, given that countries such as China benefit economically from their export industries.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,Is there a scientific consensus on man-made climate change?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Despite uncertainty about many of the details of climate change, there is a broad consensus among the world's most prestigious scientific bodies that the world is warming and that humans have played a significant role in creating that warming.

Various studies have attempted to ascertain the extent of this consensus. A survey of 928 peer-reviewed abstracts on the subject ""climate change"" published between 1993 and 2003 showed that not a single paper rejected the consensus position of man-made warming. Three-quarters of the papers reviewed implicitly or explicitly agreed with the consensus position; the other quarter were focused on analytical methods or historical climate change and made no comment either way.

Subsequent research has reached similar conclusions. A survey of 3,146 earth scientists asked the question: ""Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?"". More than 90% of respondents had PhDs, and 7% had master's degrees. Overall, 82% of the scientists answered yes, but the response rate differed markedly according to level of expertise in climate science. Of scientists who were non-climatologists or didn't publish research, 77% answered yes. By contrast, 97% of climatologists who actively publish research on climate change responded yes.

This overwhelming consensus among climate experts was confirmed by an independent study that surveyed all climate scientists who have publicly signed declarations supporting or rejecting the consensus position. It found that 97-98% of climate experts support the consensus. Moreover, the study found that the small number of scientists rejecting the consensus had published, on average, around half as many papers each as the large majority of scientists accepting the consensus position.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,Is the sun causing global warming?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Over the very long term, variations in Earth's orbit that shape where and when sunlight reaches the planet are the main cause of ice ages, but this doesn't apply to our current situation. It's true that the Sun has produced more sunspots in recent decades than it did in the early 1800s. However, this mainly reflects an increase in the ultraviolet range of sunlight, which is only a tiny part of the solar spectrum.
In fact, the total solar energy reaching Earth changes very little over time. Across the 11-year solar cycle, it varies by less than 0.1%, and even across the period since the little ice age chill of 1750, solar output climbed no more than about 0.12%, according to the 2007 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Subsequent estimates by Judith Lean of the Naval Research Laboratory and others have pegged the solar contribution to 20th-century warming at 10% or less. And a recent analysis of solar trends suggests that – over the last few decades – the sun has actually contributed a slight cooling effect, rather than accounting for any of the observed warming.
There's still a question mark or two when it comes to ultraviolet radiation, where the lion's share of solar variability occurs. It's possible that UV rays interact with ozone in the stratosphere in a way that inhibits low-level cloud formation and thereby allows more sunlight to reach the earth, but there is no strong evidence to suggest that this is a significant factor in practice.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,Can 'peak oil' help slow climate change?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"""Peak oil"" describes the point at which the production of petroleum reaches its final high-point and begins a terminal decline. Given that oil is a finite resource, everyone agrees that a peak is inevitable, but views differ about when it is likely to happen and what the impacts will be. Some experts argue that the peak is imminent and that, when markets finally wake up to this fact, the world will face severe economic consequences. Others – including many governments and energy companies – believe the peak to be decades away and argue that as oil becomes more expensive to extract, the market will naturally redirect investment towards alternative energy sources.

If those concerned about peak oil are proved correct, and a fall in oil production triggered a major economic down-swing, this would likely reduce the global rate of carbon emissions for a period, just as other recessions have done. But even a very severe global recession wouldn't reduce emissions sufficiently to ""solve"" climate change – and indeed the longer-term impact of the oil peak could be to accelerate rather than decelerate global warming. That's because falling availability of crude oil could boost the production of even more carbon-intensive alternatives such as oil extracted from tar sands or ""synfuel"" produced from coal.",a

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"The Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift – which are part of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation – bring warm water, and with it warm air, from the tropical Atlantic to northern Europe. This helps keep the UK several degrees warmer than it would otherwise be.

Although this system is unlikely to pack up entirely, the IPCC deems a slowdown of it ""very likely"" over the next century. The reason is that increasing rainfall and snow-melt across the Arctic and nearby land areas could send more freshwater into the north Atlantic, pinching off part of the warm current. The best guess from the most sophisticated computer models is that the circulation might slow by 10% to 50% over the next century, if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated. If this happens, the expected climate warming might be nearly erased across the United Kingdom and diminished across many other parts of Europe. However, summers could still be warmer and more drought-prone across the UK and Europe than they are now.

In any case, the impacts would be much smaller – and would take much longer to play out – than the scenario dramatised in the film The Day After Tomorrow. Although evidence shows that the thermohaline circulation has ground to a halt more than once in climate history, it's believed that this process takes at least a few years to play out, and sometimes many decades, rather than the few days portrayed in the film.",a

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"The planet did cool slightly from the 1940s to the 1970s, mainly in the northern hemisphere and most likely a result of the post-war boom in industrial aerosol pollutants that bounce sunlight away from the Earth. Despite a flurry of 1970s media reports on an imminent ice age, there was never anything approaching a scientific consensus on the likelihood of further cooling, and it appears that greenhouse warming has long since eclipsed the mid-century cool spell.

After temperatures reached a new global high in 1998, the following decade saw smaller ups and downs. The absence of another show-stopping record led many sceptics and pundits to claim that global warming 'stopped' in 1998. In truth, however, nobody expects the global average temperature to rise smoothly from one year to the next. Just as any April in London, New York or Beijing will see a few cold snaps, we can expect long-term warming to be punctuated by periods of little rise in global temperature, or even slight cooling, that could last for a few years. As for record warm years, these will likely coincide with El Niño conditions, which occur as part of a natural cycle in the Pacific Ocean.

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"It's not hard to imagine international tensions bubbling over as the planet heats up, and defence planners have begun to pay more attention to the risk of climate-related conflicts.

One landmark assessment prepared for the Pentagon in 2003 considered a specific scenario for abrupt climate change in which conflicts over land and water use grow through the century. If the planet's ability to support its growing population were to drop abruptly, ""humanity would revert to its norm of constant battles for diminishing resources"", the report warned. The message was underscored in 2007 with another report in which a group of retired generals and admirals concluded that ""projected climate change poses a serious threat to America's national security"".

However, the issues are very complex. Scholars have long tussled over the question of how the environment intersects with social factors to breed war. Drought, in particular, is a perennial marker of conflict but the connection isn't a simple one. The horrific violence in Darfur, Sudan, for example, followed decades of strained relations between nomadic herders and farmers, coinciding with a sustained drop in rainfall from the 1970s onward. However, the dramatic onset of warfare in 2003 doesn't appear to be directly linked to short-term dryness.

As the world's subtropics heat up and dry out, many important regions – including parts of the southwest US and northern Mexico, and the nations ringing the Mediterranean – will see an intensifying risk of major drought, which may feed other sources of societal stress and international conflict. These same parts of the world could also be well suited for hosting mammoth solar farms to send energy across international lines – another potential wrinkle in the geopolitics of tomorrow.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What are the main types of carbon capture and storage technology?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"There are three main types of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology that could eventually help reduce emissions from power stations and other industrial sites: pre-combustion, post-combustion and oxyfuel.

Post-combustion
In this method, CO2 is separated from the flue gas of the power station by bubbling the gas through an absorber column packed with liquid solvents (such as ammonia). In the most widely used system, once the chemicals in the absorber column become saturated, a stream of superheated steam at around 120C is passed through it. This releases the trapped CO2, which can then be transported for storage elsewhere.

More experimental techniques to scrub CO2 from flue gas without the two-step process include using seawater to absorb the gas and then returning the mixture back to the ocean for long-term storage. But, so far, these methods have proved less efficient and reliable.

Oxyfuel
When coal, oil or natural gas is burned in normal air, CO2 makes up around 3-15% of the waste gas – and separating it out is difficult and energy-intensive. An alternative method is to burn the fuel in pure oxygen. In this environment, virtually all the waste gas will be composed of CO2 and water vapour. The latter can be condensed out while the former can be piped or transported directly to a storage facility.

In the oxyfuel system, the challenge is separating large volumes of air into liquid oxygen, gaseous nitrogen, argon and other trace gases. This process can use up to 15% of the power produced at the station.

Pre-combustion
This method is normally applied to coal-gasification combined-cycle power plants. The coal is gasified to produce a synthetic gas made from carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The former is reacted with water to produce CO2, which is captured, and more hydrogen. The hydrogen can be diverted to a turbine where it can be burned to produce electricity. Alternatively, some of this gas can be bled off to feed hydrogen fuel cells for cars.

One disadvantage of the pre-combustion method is that it cannot be retro-fitted to the older pulverised coal power plants that make up much of the world's installed base of fossil fuel power. It could perhaps be used in natural gas stations, where a synthetic gas is first produced by reacting the methane with steam to produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen. But the economic advantage of this method over post-combustion is yet to be proven.",a

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"It may be only a matter of time. In its 2007 report, the IPCC projects that sea level will rise anywhere from 180mm to 590mm by 2090–2100. This range is smaller than in the IPCC's 2001 report, but it excludes some key uncertainties about how quickly warming will melt land-based ice. The last few years have seen glaciers accelerating their seaward flow in many spots along the margins of Greenland and West Antarctica. Computer models don't depict the dynamics behind this speed-up very well, so it's not explicitly included in the IPCC projection, but the report does note the added risk at hand. After considering new data on such melting, the US National Research Council estimated in 2010 that sea-level rise from all sources may total 500–1000mm (20–40in) by 2100 – though a report in 2011 suggested that the Greenland ice sheet may be safer than previously thought.

However big the rise turns out to be by 2100, sea level won't stop rising then, which means coastal areas will have to contend with an ever-worsening threat. If emissions continue to rise unabated through this century, the Greenland and/or West Antarctica ice sheets could be thrown into an unstoppable melting cycle that would raise sea level by more than seven metres each. This process would take some time to unfold – probably a few centuries, although nobody can pin it down at this point – but should it come to pass, many of the world's most beloved and historic cities would be hard-pressed to survive.",a

Kyoto emerged from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which was signed by nearly all nations at the 1992 mega-meeting popularly known as the Earth Summit. The framework pledges to stabilize greenhouse-gas concentrations ""at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system"". To put teeth into that pledge, a new treaty was needed, one with binding targets for greenhouse-gas reductions. That treaty was finalized in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997, after years of negotiations, and it went into force in 2005. Nearly all nations have now ratified the treaty, with the notable exception of the United States. Developing countries, including China and India, weren't mandated to reduce emissions, given that they'd contributed a relatively small share of the current century-plus build-up of CO2.

Under Kyoto, industrialised nations pledged to cut their yearly emissions of carbon, as measured in six greenhouse gases, by varying amounts, averaging 5.2%, by 2012 as compared to 1990. That equates to a 29% cut in the values that would have otherwise occurred. However, the protocol didn't become international law until more than halfway through the 1990–2012 period. By that point, global emissions had risen substantially. Some countries and regions, including the European Union, were on track by 2011 to meet or exceed their Kyoto goals, but other large nations were falling woefully short. And the two biggest emitters of all – the United States and China – churned out more than enough extra greenhouse gas to erase all the reductions made by other countries during the Kyoto period. Worldwide, emissions soared by nearly 40% from 1990 to 2009, according to the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What is carbon capture and storage?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Carbon capture and storage, also known as CCS or carbon sequestration, describes a family of technologies designed to tackle global warming by capturing CO2 – at power stations, industrial sites or even directly from the air – and permanently storing it underground.

Some experts believe that the world has little chance of reducing carbon emissions in line with scientific advice unless CCS technology becomes widely deployed in existing and future fossil-fuel power stations. By contrast, some campaigners argue that CCS may never be economic on a large scale and that its advocates may be slowing down the shift to renewable energy by holding out an unrealistic promise of ""clean coal"".

There are at least three different types of CCS system suitable for deployment in power stations: post-combustion, pre-combustion and oxyfuel. Most of the technologies involved have been proven in other contexts, but so far the various stages of CCS power generation have only been connected together at small-scale pilot projects such as a 12MW plant at Schwarze Pumpe in northern Germany.

Experts have divergent views on the economic and technical feasibility of commercial-scale CCS, but everyone agrees that it won't be cheap: up to 40% of a power station's energy could end up being used to run the CCS scrubbing and transport systems, and estimates for retro-fitting Britain's aged power stations are as high as £1bn each.

Once the CO2 has been captured, it needs to be liquefied, transported – sometimes for several hundred miles – and buried, either in suitable geological formations, deep underground saline aquifers or disused oil fields. The last method is often used in a process called ""enhanced oil recovery"", where CO2 is pumped into an oil field to force out the remaining pockets of oil that would otherwise prove difficult to extract.",a

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"There's tremendous variation in hurricane activity over time and from place to place. Various studies published since 2005 indicate that the number and/or strength of hurricanes have increased in various regions, especially since the 1970s. However, it's likely that some hurricanes at sea went unnoticed in the days before satellites and hurricane-hunter aircraft, and that complicates the assessment. There's no doubt, though, that hurricane activity has stepped up since the mid-1990s in the North Atlantic, where ocean temperatures have risen through long-term warming and an apparent multidecadal cycle in Atlantic currents. The tropics are part of a global trend toward ocean warming that goes hand in hand with atmospheric warming, and warm oceans provide the energy to drive hurricanes. As for the future, computer models tend to point towards fewer hurricanes overall (for reasons that aren't yet firmed up) but a general strengthening of winds and rainfall in the hurricanes that do form.

Trends aside, a catastrophic storm can strike in any year, and it's impossible to tie any single hurricane or other weather event directly to global warming. Take Hurricane Katrina, which ravaged New Orleans in 2005. Several hurricanes of comparable strength have been observed across the Atlantic over the past century. And the horrific damage caused to the city was the result not only of Katrina's strength but also the storm's track, the weakness of levees and many other factors. That said, the waters of the Gulf of Mexico that fuelled Katrina were at near-record warmth at the time.",a

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Early in the 20th century, the prevailing notion was that people could alter climates locally (for instance, by cutting down forests and ploughing virgin fields) but not globally. Of course, the ice ages and other wrenching climate shifts of the past were topics of research. But few considered them an immediate threat, and hardly anyone thought humans could trigger worldwide climate change. A few pioneering thinkers – such as Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius in the 1890s – had already seen the potential global impact of fossil-fuel use, but their views were typically dismissed by colleagues.

Starting in 1958, precise measurements of carbon dioxide confirmed its steady increase in the atmosphere. The first computer models of global climate in the 1960s, and more complex ones thereafter, supported the idea floated by mavericks decades before: that the addition of greenhouse gases would indeed warm the climate. Finally, global temperature itself began to rise sharply in the 1980s, which helped raise the issue's profile among the media and the public as well as scientists.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What is the carbon cycle?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Just as the ""water cycle"" describes the transfer of water molecules between rivers, oceans, land and the atmosphere, the ""carbon cycle"" refers to the flow of carbon through different parts of the Earth system – including the air and the bodies of plants and animals.

The carbon cycle is a natural and integral part of life on Earth. A single carbon atom stored in a blade of grass may shift to the body of an animal that eats the grass. When the animal dies, its body might rot, and the carbon atom could join with oxygen to form CO2 in the air. From there it might be taken in by a tree in the process of photosynthesis and used as a building block in a branch or trunk, or absorbed by the ocean. And so on.

Although the basic flows of the carbon cycle haven't significantly changed, in the last century or so humans have increased the amount of CO2 in the air by taking carbon that has been locked up in the ground for millions of years – in the form of oil, coal and gas – and releasing it into the atmosphere by burning those fuels. There is strong evidence that this has led to global warming.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What are the main man-made greenhouse gases?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"The strength of the Earth's greenhouse effect is determined by the concentration in the atmosphere of a handful of greenhouse gases. The one that causes the most warming overall is water vapour – though human activity affects its level in the atmosphere indirectly rather than directly.

The greenhouse gases that humans do emit directly in significant quantities are:

 Carbon dioxide (CO2). Accounts for around three-quarters of the warming impact of current human greenhouse-gas emissions. The key source of CO2 is the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, though deforestation is also a very significant contributor.

Methane (CH4). Accounts for around 14% of the impact of current human greenhouse-gas emissions. Key sources include agriculture (especially livestock and rice fields), fossil fuel extraction and the decay of organic waste in landfill sites. Methane doesn't persist in the atmosphere as long as CO2, though its warming effect is much more potent for each gram of gas released.

Nitrous oxide (N2O). Accounts for around 8% of the warming impact of current human greenhouse-gas emissions. Key sources include agriculture (especially nitrogen-fertilised soils and livestock waste) and industrial processes. Nitrous oxide is even more potent per gram than methane.

Fluorinated gases (""F gases""). Account for around 1% of the warming impact of current human greenhouse-gas emissions. Key sources are industrial processes. F-gases are even more potent per gram than nitrous oxide.

Human activity also changes the planet's temperature in other ways. For example, vapour trails from planes, soot from fires and and tropospheric ozone created indirectly by local pollution all tend to increase warming. On the other hand, aerosol particles produced by some vehicles and industrial processes tend to bounce sunlight away from the earth, temporarily counteracting some of the warming caused by man-made greenhouse gases.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What is geoengineering?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Geoengineering schemes are projects designed to tackle the effects of climate change directly, usually by removing CO2 from the air or limiting the amount of sunlight reaching the planet's surface. Although large-scale geoengineering is still at the concept stage, advocates claim that it may eventually become essential if the world wants to avoid the worst effects of climate change. Critics, by contrast, claim that geoengineering isn't realistic – and may be a distraction from reducing emissions.

The first category of scheme – those designed to remove CO2 from the air – include machines (sometimes called ""artificial trees"") that pull the gas from the atmosphere using plastic polymers. Other proposals seek to increase the amount of CO2 absorbed by the oceans – for example by adding large quantities of lime to the water.

Other related schemes – sometimes but not always described as geo-engineering – involve harnessing the capacity of trees and plants to absorb CO2 from the air. These include burning large quantities of wood in power plants with carbon-capture technology; making and burying large amounts of charcoal to lock carbon into the soils; and grazing cattle in a way designed to turn grasslands into giant carbon sinks.

In the second category – schemes designed to reduce the amount of sunlight reaching Earth – proposals include firing sulphate aerosols into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight back to space; using unmanned ships to increase above-ocean cloud cover by spraying sea water into the air; painting the world's roofs white to increase reflectivity; and even floating thousands of tiny mirrors in space between Earth and the sun.

Some geoengineering schemes, such as adding aerosols to the stratosphere, have attracted heavy criticism for their possible side effects. Even if these side-effects weren't severe, schemes that ""mask"" the temperature rise rather than removing the CO2 come with some serious disadvantages, such as the fact that they don't deal with CO2's other major impact: ocean acidification. Administering any such scheme would also raise obvious issues of geopolitics and global governance.

Other schemes, such as the machines designed to suck CO2 directly out of the air, are far less controversial, since all they aim to do is remove a pollutant that humans are adding to the air. The main challenges in this case are reducing manufacturing and running costs to make the devices commercially viable, and finding reliable and inexpensive ways to store the captured gas.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What is the economic cost of climate change?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Economics and climate change are both complex subjects that contain significant areas of uncertainty – especially when it comes to making long-term predictions. Inevitably, therefore, it's impossible to accurately predict with any certainty the long-term economic costs of avoiding or coping with the impacts of climate change.

Part of the complexity stems from the number of factors involved. For example, the cost of reducing future emissions will depend on the prevailing prices of fossil fuels and alternative forms of energy – which in turn will depend on factors as diverse as depletion of energy reserves, economic growth, demographics, government incentives, cost of metals and technological progress.

Similarly, the cost of dealing with rising temperatures will depend – among many other things – on the sensitivity of the climate to greenhouse gases, the location and severity of regional climate impacts, and the mechanisms of climate feedback loops.

Even if there weren't any uncertainties, putting a price on climate policies would still raise some difficult methodological and philosophical questions. For instance, how should economists value ecosystems and the services they produce, or indeed human lives? And how should they value economic and social wellbeing today relative to economic and social wellbeing in the future? In other words, what discount rate should they apply?

Despite these complications, many economists have done work modelling the most likely economic costs and benefits of different approaches to dealing with climate change. The most prominent report published to date on this topic is the Stern Review, which concluded that the best way to protect the global economy in the long term was to act swiftly to reduce emissions in the near term.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What is the Stern review?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"The Stern review on the economics of climate change is an influential report published in 2006. It was commissioned by Gordon Brown, then UK chancellor of the exchequer, and written by Sir Nicholas Stern, an expert in economics and development who had previously served as the chief economist at the World Bank, among many other roles.

Stern and his team set out to examine ""the economic impacts of climate change itself"" and ""the economics of stabilising greenhouse gases in the atmosphere"" – plus the policy challenges of creating a low-carbon economy and managing adaption to a changing climate. The report, which ran to many hundreds of pages, concluded that:

    ""The evidence shows that ignoring climate change will eventually damage economic growth. Our actions over the coming few decades could create risks of major disruption to economic and social activity, later in this century and in the next, on a scale similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half of the 20th century. And it will be difficult or impossible to reverse these changes. Tackling climate change is the pro-growth strategy for the longer term, and it can be done in a way that does not cap the aspirations for growth of rich or poor countries. The earlier effective action is taken, the less costly it will be.""

More specifically, the review warns that ignoring climate change could reduce global GDP by 20% by the end of the century, and that to avoid this risk the world should spend 1% of global GDP a year, starting immediately.

In 2008, however, Stern announced that his report had underestimated the speed and scale of some serious climate impacts and increased his recommendation for expenditure on emissions reductions to 2% of global GDP. Nonetheless, by Stern's analysis, ignoring climate change is still many times more expensive than fixing it.

We'll deal with some of the debate about Stern's approach to climate economics in future questions.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,How do trees and forests relate to climate change?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Deforestation, and especially the destruction of rainforests, is a hugely significant contributor to climate change. Scientists estimate that forest loss and other changes to the use of land account for around 23% of current man-made CO2 emissions – which equates to 17% of the 100-year warming impact of all current greenhouse-gas emissions.

As children are taught at school, trees and other plants absorb CO2 from the air as they grow. Using energy from the sun, they turn the carbon captured from the CO2 molecules into building blocks for their trunks, branches and foliage. This is all part of the carbon cycle.

A mature forest doesn't necessarily absorb much more CO2 that it releases, however, because when each tree dies and either rots down or is burned, much of its stored carbon is released once again. In other words, in the context of climate change, the most important thing about mature forests is not that they reduce the amount of CO2 in the air but that they are huge reservoirs of stored carbon. If such a forest is burned or cleared then much of that carbon is released back into the atmosphere, adding to atmospheric CO2 levels.

Of course, the same process also works in reverse. If trees are planted where previously there weren't any, they will on soak up CO2 as they grow, reducing the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. It is thought that trees, plants and other land-based ""carbon sinks"" currently soak up more than a quarter of all the CO2 that humans add to the air each year – though that figure could change as the planet warms.

Unsurprisingly, the relationship between trees and local and global temperature is more complicated than the simple question of the greenhouse gases they absorb and emit. Forests have a major impact on local weather systems and can also affect the amount of sunlight absorbed by the planet: a new area of trees in a snowy region may create more warming than cooling overall by darkening the land surface and reducing the amount of sunlight reflected back to space.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,How do volcanoes affect the climate?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"When volcanoes erupt, they emit a mixture of gases and particles into the air. Some of them, such as ash and sulphur dioxide, have a cooling effect, because they (or the substances they cause) reflect sunlight away from the earth. Others, such as CO2, cause warming by adding to the the greenhouse effect.

The cooling influence is particularly marked in the case of large eruptions able to blast sun-blocking particles all the way up to the stratosphere – such as Mount Pinatubo in 1991, which caused a significant dip in global temperatures in the following year or two. It's difficult to know for sure that the cooling observed after a particular eruption is definitely the result of that eruption, but examining the average global temperature change after multiple eruptions proves a strong link.

As for greenhouse gases, underwater and land-based volcanoes are estimated to release, in total, around 100–300 million tonnes of CO2 each year, according to the British Geological Survey and the US Geological Survey. That's a large quantity, but only around 1% of the amount that humans release from burning fossil fuel alone.

As a rule, the cooling influence of an individual volcano will dominate for the period immediately after the eruption but the warming impact will last much longer. So the significance of each depends on the timeframe being considered. A very large volcano in 2011 may significantly reduce temperatures in 2012 but slightly warm them in 2100.

It has sometimes been suggested by those who seek to disprove human impact on the climate that volcanoes release more CO2 than human activity. This is simply incorrect. As the British Geological Survey puts it:

    ""The contribution to the present day atmospheric CO2 loading from volcanic emissions is … relatively insignificant.""

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What is carbon?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Carbon is a chemical element, like hydrogen, oxygen, lead or any of the others in the periodic table.

Carbon is a very abundant element. It exists in pure or nearly pure forms – such as diamonds and graphite – but can also combine with other elements to form molecules. These carbon-based molecules are the basic building blocks of humans, animals, plants, trees and soils. Some greenhouse gases, such as CO2 and methane, also consist of carbon-based molecules, as do fossil fuels, which are largely made up of hydrocarbons (molecules consisting of hydrogen and carbon).

In the context of climate change, ""carbon"" is commonly used as a shorthand for carbon dioxide, the most important greenhouse gas released by humans. Technically, however, this isn't accurate. Carbon only becomes carbon dioxide when each atom of carbon joins with two atoms of oxygen (hence the chemical formula of carbon dioxide, CO2).

This shorthand can sometimes cause confusion, because although ""a tonne of carbon"" will often be used to mean ""a tonne of CO2"", in a scientific context the same phrase could mean ""CO2 containing a tonne of carbon"" (which is a much smaller amount, as oxygen accounts for most of the weight of each CO2 molecule).

The term carbon also crops up in the phrase carbon footprint, which describes the total amount of greenhouse gases released as the result of a given activity. In this context, ""a tonne of carbon"" may mean something else still: ""a mix of greenhouse gases with a combined warming impact equivalent to that of a tonne of CO2"".

Carbon molecules move around the Earth system in the carbon cycle.",a

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"It's true that water vapour is the biggest overall contributor to the greenhouse effect and that humans are not responsible for directly emitting this gas in quantities sufficient to change its concentration in the atmosphere. However, the scientific evidence suggests that the warming caused by man-made emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases is increasing the amount of water vapour in the air by boosting the rate of evaporation.

Unlike CO2, which can persist in the air for centuries, water vapour cycles through the atmosphere quickly, evaporating from the oceans and elsewhere before coming back down as rain or snow. Since the rate of evaporation rises with temperature, the amount of water vapour in the air at any one time (and the amount of warming it causes) is strongly related to the amount of other greenhouse gases in the air.

This is an example of a positive feedback loop: humans release CO2, which causes warming, which boosts evaporation, which in turn amplifies the warming. Indeed, scientists believe that evaporation is the most important positive feedback loop in the global climate system, doubling or tripling the sensitivity of the climate to CO2 emissions.

This explains why, despite water vapour constituting the largest part of the greenhouse effect, the world's science academies have agreed, there is strong evidence that human activities are driving the observed change in temperatures.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What is the greenhouse effect?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"The greenhouse effect is one of the main factors determining the temperature of a planet. It's the phenomenon by which certain gases – so-called greenhouse gases – in the atmosphere trap heat that would otherwise escape to space, thereby keeping the planet warm.

The greenhouse effect is not a man-made phenomenon. The Earth's atmosphere has always contained greenhouse gases, such as CO2, and they have always caused warming. If there was no greenhouse effect, the planet would be uninhabitably cold – more than 30C colder than the hospitable current average of 15C.

However, humans are changing the strength of the greenhouse effect by increasing the proportion of greenhouse gases in the air. For example, CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased from around 315 parts per million (ppm) to 387 ppm since 1959.

Although scientists are still researching many details of greenhouse warming, the basic principles of the greenhouse effect were discovered in the nineteenth century and are accepted by virtually all scientists.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,How much warmer will the planet get?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"No one can say exactly how much warmer the planet will become over the coming years, decades and centuries. Partly that's due to the simple fact that it's impossible to know how much greenhouse gas humans will emit in the future. But it's also because scientists can't predict exactly how ""sensitive"" the atmosphere will be to those emissions. There are other areas of uncertainty, too, such as possible future changes to the rate at which oceans and land areas absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and the various feedback loops that could accelerate warming caused by man-made emissions. Due to these unknowns, scientists usually provide a range of possible future temperature changes for any one emissions scenario.

In its most recent assessment of the science, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) examined a range of emissions scenarios. In the scenario where the rise in greenhouse emissions doesn't level off until the latter part of the century, the best estimate temperature rise by 2100 came out at 4.0C, with a ""likely range"" of 2.4–6.4C. By contrast, in a scenario where emissions were very rapidly brought down, the best estimate was 1.8 degrees, with a likely range of 1.1–2.9C.

Because of inertia in the climate system and the long life of some greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, scientists estimate that the world would continue to warm substantially – by roughly a further 0.6C – even if humans completely stopped emitting greenhouse gases today.

However much the temperature rises, there will still be regional variation, as this Met Office map of a world after a 4C rise makes clear.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,Climate change: Does a small temperature rise actually matter?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"So far, global warming has been limited to a rise of around 0.75C since the end of the 19th century. This sounds like a small change, but the scientific evidence suggests it is already leading to a range of impacts around the world. As we'll explore in future questions, these impacts includes changes to sea level, rainfall patterns, ecosystems and some kinds of extreme weather.

It's worth noting that the temperature rise observed to date isn't spread evenly around the planet. As can be seen clearly in maps of temperature change (such as those created by Nasa), the increase has been particularly steep in the Arctic, where the climate system is more sensitive to warming than most of the rest of the world, partly due to feedback loops in the local climate that amplify the warming.

More importantly, however, is that the temperature rise observed so far is not the chief cause of concern. More worrying is the significantly larger temperature rise (and associated changes in rainfall, snowfall, sea level and other phenomena) that scientists expect the world to experience in the coming decades and centuries.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,What are climate change feedback loops?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"In climate change, a feedback loop is the equivalent of a vicious or virtuous circle – something that accelerates or decelerates a warming trend. A positive feedback accelerates a temperature rise, whereas a negative feedback decelerates it.

Scientists are aware of a number of positive feedbacks loops in the climate system. One example is melting ice. Because ice is light-coloured and reflective, a large proportion of the sunlight that hits it is bounced back to space, which limits the amount of warming it causes. But as the world gets hotter, ice melts, revealing the darker-coloured land or water below. The result is that more of the sun's energy is absorbed, leading to more warming, which in turn leads to more ice melting – and so on.

Various other feedbacks – related to emissions from soils and permafrost, for example, and changes to ocean evaporation – are known or thought to exist.

Feedback loops such as these are complex in themselves and even more complex when considered as part of an integrated global climate system. Some are already at work, while others have yet to kick in. Others still – both positive and negative – may yet be discovered. These uncertainties, coupled with historical evidence for the climate changing rapidly in the past, led one prominent climate scientist to compare releasing greenhouse gases into the air with ""poking a beast with a sharp stick"".",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,Are humans definitely causing global warming?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Just as the world's most respected scientific bodies have confirmed that world is getting hotter, they have also stated that there is strong evidence that humans are driving the warming. The 2005 joint statement from the national academies of Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, the UK and the US said:

    ""It is likely that most of the warming in recent decades can be attributed to human activities.""

Countless more recent statements and reports from the world's leading scientific bodies have said the same thing. For example, a 2010 summary of climate science by the Royal Society stated that:

    ""There is strong evidence that the warming of the Earth over the last half-century has been caused largely by human activity, such as the burning of fossil fuels and changes in land use, including agriculture and deforestation.""

The idea that humans could change the planet's climate may be counter-intuitive, but the basic science is well understood. Each year, human activity causes billions of tonnes of greenhouse gases to be released into the atmosphere. As scientists have known for decades, these gases capture heat that would otherwise escape to space – the equivalent of wrapping the planet in an invisible blanket.

Of course, the planet's climate has always been in flux thanks to ""natural"" factors such as changes in solar or volcanic activity, or cycles relating the Earth's orbit around the sun. According to the scientific literature, however, the warming recorded to date matches the pattern of warming we would expect from a build up of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere – not the warming we would expect from other possible causes.

Even if scientists did discover another plausible explanation for the warming observed to date, that would beg a difficult question. As Robert Henson puts it in The Rough Guide to Climate Change:

    ""If some newly discovered factor can account for the climate change then why aren't carbon dioxide and the other greenhouse gases producing the warming that basic physics tells us they should be?""

The only way to prove with 100% certainty that humans are responsible for global warming would be to run an experiment with two identical Earths – one with human influence and one without. That obviously isn't possible, and so most scientists are careful not to state human influence as an absolute certainty. Nonetheless, the evidence is now extremely strong.",a
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,Is the world really getting warmer?,q
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Yes. There is agreement among the scientific community that the earth has warmed in the last century. Here's how the world's most prestigious scientific bodies put it in a joint statement signed by the heads of the national science academies in Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, the UK and the US:

    ""Climate change is real. There will always be uncertainty in understanding a system as complex as the world's climate. However there is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring. The evidence comes from direct measurements of rising surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures and from phenomena such as increases in average global sea levels, retreating glaciers, and changes to many physical and biological systems.""

In other words, we know that the planet is warming because temperature measurements show it and because these measurements are borne out by observations such as rising sea levels, retreating snow cover and glaciers, longer growing seasons and shifting wildlife. There's a good summary of ten different warming indicators – all of which support the theory that temperatures are increasing – in this report by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The same academies listed above – which represent the definitive voice of science in each country – have restated their position on global warming a number of times since that original statement was issued in 2005. The most recent joint statement from 2009 said that ""climate change is happening even faster than previously estimated"".

The IPCC, a UN scientific body convened to assess and surmise science relating to climate change, stated in its last assessment of the evidence that ""warming of the climate system is unequivocal"". The same report – drawing on the full range of published science papers on the subject – points to a rise of about three-quarters of a degree celsius in the past century, with much of that warming taking place over the past few decades.

Of course, the fact that the world is warming doesn't mean that it is getting hotter in a uniform way. The long-term rise in temperature is affected by shorter term factors such as changes in solar activity and regional cycles such as the oscillation between El Niño and La Niña conditions in the Pacific. And some regions – such as the Arctic – are warming significantly faster than others.

Taken as a whole, however, and averaged out over decades to remove year-to-year variability, the warming trend is clear.",a

Climate change is used interchangeably with another phrase – ""global warming"" – reflecting the strong warming trend that scientists have observed over the past century or so.

This agreement led to the Kyoto protocol, which committed participating developed nations to modest emissions reductions in the period 2008–2012. However, despite years of negotiations, world leaders haven't yet managed to reach a follow-up agreement that would see emissions reduced rapidly and steeply enough to provide a good chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 2C – a target that more than 100 governments signed up to in late 2009 as part of the Copenhagen accord.

There are many reasons why it has proved difficult to negotiate an ambitious and binding global deal for emissions reductions. For example, the long life of CO2 in the atmosphere raises philosophically and politically difficult questions about historical responsibility for climate change, just as the importing and exporting of goods blurs responsibility for contemporary emissions. The challenge of squaring long-term global benefits with short-term political cycles and development goals is another hurdle – as is the simple fact that some policy-makers, and many voters, don't accept that climate change is happening, despite the scientific evidence.",a

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-ultimate-climate-change-faq,"Climate, like weather, describes the state of the atmosphere in terms of factors such as temperature, wind and rainfall. But whereas weather describes conditions as measured in hours, days or weeks, the climate is average weather conditions measured over the longer term: months, years or decades.

At least that's the way it's usually described. The truth is actually a tiny bit more complex because climate also encompasses variability – for example, the frequency of extreme weather events.

The distinction between weather and climate is an important one. For example, weather forecasts can be fairly specific (""it will be rainy tomorrow morning and cold in the afternoon, with temperatures dipping close to freezing"") but are little use more than a few days into the future. By contrast, climate predictions focus on expected changes in average conditions, while recognising that individual days, weeks, months or years will always buck the longer-term trend.

Each area of the world has its own climate (and indeed its own weather), though scientists also study the planet's overall climate system – for example by tracking the average global temperature.

The term climate comes from the Greek klinein, or ""slope"", describing how the angle that the sun hits the earth varies in different regions.",a
